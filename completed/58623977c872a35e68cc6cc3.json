{"comments":[{"Question":"8. Comments about Co-op Values?","Comments":["Oryana has been by far the most difficult place I've worked at when it comes to having support for my disability-related needs. There have been pushback and barriers -- financially and structurally -- every step of the way.\n\nAs far as environmental stewardship education, we could be doing far more. There are so many good organizations in the area that we could partner with to mutual benefit (SEEDS, GTRLC, and the GTCD, to name a few). We don't even actually recycle the things we label as recycling in most areas of the stores.","It seem s like it is sometimes loosing the co-op \nfell","The culture of the co-op is toxic and destructive. The people interacting with the customers and our community on a daily basis are not respected, cared for, or listened to when concerns or positive critique are brought to upper management.","Oryana's false claims of standing for the community are getting thinner every day. Getting rid of the green discount was the first seriously for-profit decision made (that I know of). That discount was the reason that a lot of customers went to Oryana. A lot of people simply do not have a car and cannot afford good food. The green discount helped them get good food. Then, the firing of Will without warning. For no good reason. He had worked here so long. And now, he's gone. Lastly, the performative activism displayed outside of the bathrooms. Oh, we donated 600 dollars to gay people. Oh, we care about the community. I have seen grocery bills thrice as costly as that donation. That's not even half an hour of profit. You guys don't care.","Could be improved in areas of community, model work place and wellness as well as could see more broad education opportunities.","It's comforting to know that Oryana is a safe place all employees and customers.","i think the direction the co-op is taking is sacrificing it's stated values","I feel that recently they are more of a marketing ploy than core values. I’d share more but I know this isn’t truly anonymous.","No comments, I strongly align with the coops values as an employee.","I feel the goal of exceptional customer service is failing!","I really like the idea that businesses should have a mindset of working to improve or maintain the community they operate within. I think the country would benefit from this being a more widely adopted corporate goal. It makes me feel good to work at a company that shares my values.","The current Oryana Upper management may value the lives of people in our community but falls short of providing for their employees by failing to support a livable wage (for Traverse City residents, the recommended base-pay is around 22 dollars an hour.) They have made \"business decisions\" that directly put stress on their employees through the instatement of the points system, which hurts the employee when sick or undergoing a life event. At my previous corporate job, they were even more forgiving than this community led and organized by allowing us 12 points instead of Oryana's measly 7 points. A healthy community and coop start with healthy employees, and me and several other employees do not feel supported by the current Upper management. While working at this COMMUNITY coop, I am on food stamps.","I think our values are talked about more than they are put into action. Often, it seems we talk more about our performance/business metrics than we talk about or experience our organization making a difference. I don’t see our co-op being run cooperatively amongst the workers or with true involvement from our surrounding community. Instead, I experience an environment where orders are given by management or customers and the employees are here to do the physical labor required. Outside of this survey I’m not asked for my input or opinion on the direction of the department I’m directly part of, or the greater goals/actions of Oryana as an organization. I see the written values posted around but struggle to see them realized in my daily experience.","I think our return policy is far too lenient. People are taking advantage of it. It just makes us look good. I don't think it's worth it for what we lose.","THE CO OP HAS BEEN LOSING IT'S FOCUS ON THESE VALUES. WHEN I STARTED HERE, YOU COULD SEE THE VALUES IN THE INGREDIENTS AND IN THE WAY PEOPLE WERE TREATED. UPPER MANAGEMENT HAS BECOME VERY PROTECTIVE ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE AND WITH STAFF. WOMEN ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST, AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE A MIND OF THEIR OWN GET PUSHED OUT OR FIRED. ALSO GET IN TROUBLE WHEN STAFF SUGGESTS SOMETHING. NOW, EVERYONE AT WEST IS AFRAID OF WHAT GENEVIEVE WILL SAY OR IF SHE WILL EXPLODE AT THEM, SO NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING WHEN SOMETHING IS AGAINST CO-OP VALUES FOR FEAR OF REPRIMAND.","The mission statement and ends policies (which I assume is what constitutes the values being asked about) seem to be more of a cultivated vibe than actions Oryana is continuing to take. The new attendence policies are discriminatory towards employees and do not work to foster teamwork or a model workplace at all. I've also seen a lot of pulling away from local suppliers to favor national chains, so not investing in our local community as much as I would like to see.","I have seen a very fair standard of employment at Oryana. I have also taken some OU classes that address DEI policies.","I believe that Oryana should place greater emphasis on education as an end.  I just don't see much of that.","I believe our co-op values is what sets us apart from other local grocers.  With the \"threat\" of Whole Foods coming to town I believe we need to be poised to continue to demonstrate these values strongly to our customers.","Not big on hearing everyone's ideas unless you are at the top.","The co-op fires women who are not white. The co-op sells more and more items that are unhealthy, ultra processed, contain pfos, are marketed as small brands but actually owned by corporations or private equity. That tells me all I need to know about how we as a co-op really operate.","I believe Oryana on the whole manages to operate within the \"Co-op Values\" value structure.","I feel, everyone who works here is comfortable being themselves without worry. It's very nice.","I think Oryana could do a better job of hiring people with diverse racial backgrounds\nIt would be nice to see more people of color working at our stores","The assistant kitchen manager referred to people who limp as gimps, i have limped for 40 years and was deeply offended and insulted. when i reported it i didn't feel respected and even felt unsafe when telling this to the HD manager and the store manager, who yelled at me in defense of me stating my feelings regarding his statements.\nI feel disability is not popular enough diversity to be acknowledged or respected at Oryana.","Nothing of major note","I agree Oryana is a model workplace that supports their employees.","While Oryana has made strides to become more diverse with differing gender identities, we are still pretty white as a staff and mangers. We definite have not been inclusive of those with physical and intellectual challenges.","Seems like some of new hires cannot do days work. Good that people are given chance, but they are not good choice. Maybe there is nobody else availabe.","I strongly believe that in recent years the Co-Op has shifted its focus from the community and employees to a corporate and consumerist approach. The environment being fostered by upper management no longer aligns with the core beliefs of creating a safe, understanding, and empathetic work environment. I, and many of the coworkers I have spoken to, feel this way. The new actions and policies implemented need to be reevaluated to ensure we are continuing to work towards the \"Ends\" listed above, because they are clearly not being enforced in real life.","There is an abundance of inclusion but a serious lack of equity.  The needs of the company come before and above the need's individual.  Different standards are held for men and women in managerial positions and often managers have a double standard.  I've been personally harassed by two different female managers based on my clothing that was within company policy.","Great place to work and enjoy yourself.","I think we are dong a good job with this.","I deeply value working at the co-op because its principles align closely with my own. That said, I believe there are areas to enhance our alignment with co-op values. I'm eager to collaborate with upper management to discuss strategic improvements to further strengthen our alignment with co-op values.","It’s a one-sided political and religious organization.","Within the last two years there has been a huge shift between exercising our coop values and showing off the values in order to show an image, not the reality. Time and time again our management has continued to change and shift the way oryana operates. We have gotten rid of discounts that help the community, do not respect hard working employees, gotten rid of numerous jobs causing lots of issues in every department, cut hours just enough to not pay benefits, true community outreach has gone down, management will bully and push employees to there breaking point of leaving, we do not practice communication and collaboration with employee's, management, and the community. It has been truly a heartbreak to see a business that has strived for the original owner's goal for over 50 years, but due to new management in the last two years we do not follow those values. We have turned from a place that many people value to a harsh work environment that no one feels as though we are doing good for every community around us. We have had a discount called the green discount for many years, we had gotten rid of it over the last year due to us getting rid of equipment and making sure it was handled properly in recycling. The issue with this is that we as employee's have been told that we are thriving in our profit region but continue to make changes that make Oryana have more profit instead of helping and push the values that has been the center point of Oryana. In every department employees will be rushing to get work done each day to the point that breaks do not always occur, we are not able to provide usual service, numerous jobs taken away and told are not needed(or we are unable to pay for anymore) despite being already understaffed, we've had many individual's who have worked here for five to ten years(or longer) that have had to leave due to the changes, and a steady stream of individual's getting hired and leaving after a few months due the environment.  In the past two and half years oryana has become drastically different from what it was when I started.","I believe our values have held true since I have been working for Oryana","Oryana doesn't meet it's own goals right at the door, which is how management treats the staff. Oryana management doesn't listen to the voices of other employees at all levels, doesn't treat employees well, constantly makes the work environment more stressful and doesn't pay the staff a proper wage, while at the same time constantly giving away money. That money given away belongs to those who created that excess wealth, rather than those who squeeze us like a sponge for it. Always striving for more productivity out of the same staff positions. Sarah deserves to work at the cafe for a month to see what it's like for us, with out wages.","Culinary only has one female shift lead and I feel we could be more inclusive with that. Especially in the cafe. A second lead is needed and it should be a female.","I think we are far from a model workplace. Communication, transparency and compensation could be better. I don't see clear policy in regard to employees who have different levels of abilities, both physical and mental. Different departments and individuals seem to be held to different standards.","I feel a lot of the values are based more on virtue signaling than actual core principles of the co-op. There is a serious problem here with morale. Why do so many employees feel unappreciated, overworked, stressed, and dejected? Because they feel their problems are not being addressed. Example- We are super management heavy, but when it comes to getting product out on the floor and keeping the shelves faced and esthetically pleasing, we are struggling. We need more hands on deck. Staff can not keep up with the amount of product moving, in an effort to due so, we burn our selves out. This is bad for the employee and feeling overwhelmed makes it hard to give good customer service. You feel as though even the customers don't see how hard you are trying and it leaves one feeling that nothing is good enough."]},{"Question":"18. Comments about Co-op Management Practices?","Comments":["I have heard of others experiencing \"walls\" when bringing forward concerns to management.","Within the café spaces between both stores there is only a singular lead and information regarding our jobs or any changes are not able to be properly conveyed due to there only being one.","I think management needs to get more input/feedback from employees when instating new policies, such as the attendance points system. Often there are different, valuable perspectives and experiences from people at the \"lower rungs\" of the organization. We are, after all, the ones who see and are affected by how policies work on the ground, and have to bear the brunt of ones that are ineffective, counter-productive, or could affect our employment status. Overall I have gotten pushback when I bring up things that do not work in practice. Some policies have stayed in effect for my 3+ years here that no one on the ground level agrees with and we have to disobey to get our jobs done well.","Hourly employees are frequently retaliated against. Work life balance is not a concern for management. The attendance points system is overly strict, petty and actively punishes workers with school age children and families. The GM refuses to advocate for hourly employees best interests and instead caters policy to over paid executive managers prioritizing their salaries and bonuses instead of the overall financial well being of hourly paid workers. Management actively punishes employees that bring any critical feedback to their policies. Hourly employees were allowed zero input and feedback in the creation of policies in the employee handbook that directly effect their employment with the co-op. The GM seems more concerned about collecting her NCG salary and going on frequent vacations than listening to the concerns of hourly paid employees.","I do not feel safe, listened to, or comfortable in my workplace when it comes to grievances, communicating with management about issues from equipment failure to the needs of my department including safety concerns to myself and co-workers. This is, specifically, upper management. They would neglect to include our direct department manager in investigations and questioning specific to the department. Often our direct manager was the last to be updated and not given the chance to support and/or hold accountable the employees in their care. The concerns of the department have been frequently belittled and disregarded. It has been shown to us on multiple occasions, by upper management, that fellow staff members are not to be treated with equal kindness, hospitality, or respect as our customers.","Let me tell you how angry I have been with the management here. You guys jaunt around the store pretending to be useful. But hardly any of you know a damn thing about cashiering/stocking/customer service.","Although I feel the coop manages conflict well I do not see them as genuinely interested in improving employment from employee wants/feedback","I don't actually know the \"conflict resolution procedure.\" However maybe managers being very open with where and how to find them, would be a better way of discriminating this information instead of it being part of the onboarding process. I know that most stuff in onboarding goes in one ear and out the other, but having a manager come up to you on your first day and directly say \"if you have any problems or anything, this is where to find me and when ill be there.\"","I think management is interested in the needs and welfare of staff at a store level but in management - I feel there is an expectation to maintain a facade of being able to \"\nhandle it all with a smile\" when that may not be the case.","The work environment/morale in the kitchen has not been the best lately, and management is playing a part in that.","we do a great job in this regard","Management has become overbearing and has made changes to my department and the company as a whole without clearly communicating their intent, and has failed to involve the individuals working my department.","Management could not be more disconnected from staff on the floor. But this is symptomatic of businesses that adopt more corporate styled practices of prioritizing profits over people. Having management wander around the store and fixating on additional tasks for staff or implementing new ideas with zero input from those whose daily routines are directly affected is not effective communication or management. Furthermore, staff has no voice in the management or direction of Oryana, removal of the ability to have a staff member on the board of directors is no more a conflict of interest than having a Oryana CEO be president of the NGC board. The Board should receive and hear direct input from staff.","store support positions should be able and willing to help out in all departments, same with floor managers, however that is not the case.  also communication and understanding of how to be efficient could be improved. for example, having the day time floor manager hold a huddle for the night time crew doesn't make sense. store support needs to be at the huddle too, because they are often the subject of conversation.","Handbook is not applied equally across the board, especially the points system.","Until recently Oryana was a fun, happy place to work, lately the Upper level management has been micromanaging departments, getting visibly frustrated with employees in front of their team, and implementing and strongly enforcing new policies without adequate notice. Morale used to be extremely high at Oryana, recently, mostly due to the actions of upper management, the morale is dropping fast.","i feel like the conflict resolution procedure take too long, once things are reported it has been a week or more later before talks have happened and by that time most cant remember what was said or done.","my department leads are great, but upper management at the co-op is disrespectful, unorganized, micromanaging, and terrible at communication","No comments at this time. (Respectfully, Please make this truly anonymous if you want the most honest of responses <3 /gen)","I have no clue where to file complaints or suggestions, especially if I’d like to do so anonymously.\nDecisions made by management and HR are rarely if ever clearly explained, and corpo-speak gets in the way of having any real conversation 99% of the time.\nManagement has made demands of my department specifically that not a single person agrees with, yet we have to go with it because the last person who said something was fired for “insubordination”.\nThe management needs an ego check.","I do not agree that policies have been applied equally to employees, for example, wardrobe appears to be a subjective topic.","No comment. I feel like the workplace here allows for open and honest conversations","Question #14. The attendance policy which is severely flawed dose not apply to the people that wrote it! WHY? I didn't think I hired into a do as I say not as I do environment. This is absolutely no reflection on my direct manager. But \"upper level\" management including \"HD\" need to get a grip on this soon!","I said no opinion for a lot of these because I am largely unfamiliar with the management practices. I have never personally been involved in or witnessed the resolution of any workplace conflicts or situations where corrective action was taken to address an issue. I have confidence in the management team to be thoughtful, ethical, and competent in their approach to managing the organization. I would be interested in a process or channel that provided an easy and clear way to provide input on operations, and while I expect this is something that already exists, I am not familiar with it and it would benefit from some advertisement or something","Regarding question 12, I know what to with a grievance with changes in company policies. I know to keep my mouth shut because management would dismiss my comments anyway. I know they would not take me seriously. I know they put stress on my department about our practices, and I cannot find a reason why our practices and displays would be put down by Genevieve specifically, other than to assert control. For example, my department used to have a sale rack and many customers who have a smaller budget or were looking for a better deal could go, and now it is harder for them to find good deals, inconvenient for us when resetting our shelves, and I cannot figure why. Positively, I know there are routes for me to express concerns about other employees, and there are ways for me to get in touch securely. Very sincerely, there is a reason Oryana cannot become a B-rated Corporation, and I believe management is the core reason and problem we cannot.","I don’t even know where to begin because there is such a massive chasm between management and employees. I my time here I can count on one hand the times management has acknowledged me, even with a simple hello. It doesn’t foster open communication when upper management can’t even offer a simple smile or “good morning!” that we are expected to give every random person who walks through the door. There is a massive split between “upstairs” and “downstairs” employees and how information is discussed and shared. We receive directives and commands without being consulted about their best implementation. We are the resident experts in our departments and yet we don’t have any input or say about changes to our departments? \n\nA great example is last year’s Thanksgiving culinary process. We were told a new way of doing things was to be done without being consulted and it was devastating to our sales during that crucial sales season. We stretched our employees thin while being constantly understaffed and navigating shrinking employee benefits.\n\nAnother good example is our attendance policy which doesn’t apply to management. If we have to call in sick we are given an attendance point, unless we have to be sick 2 or more days in a row, then that point drops off. So, as I see it, we incentivize employees to call out for 2 days instead of 1. If we get in a car accident or have a house emergency (2 events that happened to my coworkers) then we have to appeal to upper management constantly to review and excuse our attendance points accrued for that emergency event. It’s exhausting to feel the pressure of a system like this that our upstairs managerial overlords are able to simply be exempt from. I’m here and show up day after day to serve this community and I feel like my honesty is in question when I have to miss a day. That’s no way to treat valued employees. \n\nI have no channel of communication to upper management except through my direct manager. I don’t have access to a computer or an email/internal messaging system to write emails to anyone so there’s no record of communications and no accountability when issues fall through the gaping cracks. \n\nThere’s really so much more to discuss here…. I can’t think of it all on the spot.","I don't believe differences of opinion are respected or valued. Most changes that are made, are made without the input of those whom the change impacts. Management is only open to changes that some from upper management.","SEE ABOVE COMMENT. THE PROBLEM ISN'T SARAH. IT IS GENEVIEVE AND VICTOR.","Oryana has a problem with not trusting their employees and seeing/investing in the incredible teams that make up the various departments here. The employees care about the mission and truly value what we do for our community here, and even going so far as to take initiative and improve things just because we care and can do things better for those we serve. Unfortunately that is not rewarded by those making big policy decisions. Instead, most recently with this new attendence policy that is merely a demerits system, only some employees are beholden to it, and it's simply a system to punish employees. Our direct manager DOES see what we're doing and values and rewards our efforts and achievements and collaborative efforts -- I just wanted to make a point to call that out because it's important","I had some disagreements with a specific incident that happened with our previous GM and was unsure how to elevate it. I think the correct action would have been to talk to the Board of Directors. I felt overwhelmed by the process and didn't follow up with my concerns. I knew the former GM would be retiring soon and decided not to act. I was hopeful that our new GM would handle things differently, and I know that she would conduct herself differently.","As a very part-time employee I have limited understanding of the conflict resolution process.","When there are management meetings it would seem appropriate for staff \"in the trenches\" to be queried so as feedback and ideas can be voiced at the meetings.  I have not seen that happen.\nI thought the concept of \"lunch with leadership\" was a good one, however; I never saw any outcomes or information from that and they have stopped and I don't remember reading why.\nThere is a lot of gossip when staff are reprimanded.  If a staff is behaving or performing in a manner that goes against what is in the handbook why are they not written up as opposed to being reprimanded.\nI have the likely unpopular opinion that the new points/attendance system is a good one.  It seems fairly fundamental that employees arrive on time AND ready to work.  Perhaps an explanation for those new to the workforce on how tardiness can impact a business.","HD department provides a very supportive network of professionals and resources to discuss grievances in and out of the workplace.","again only care about higher up's idea","I don't know what happens when people become managers at Oryana but there is a serious invasion of the body snatchers / stepford wives vibe. It's honestly not worth it bringing issues up to management or the board. I like a lot of them personally but there is something sick about the system here.","handbook dress codes need to be enforced. Management feels separated from the floor staff.","I heard of a situation where I believe an employee was treated poorly for bringing up what I thought were valid concerns. This knowledge colors my belief that the process is always fair.","Very strong lack of communication between management and the staff underneath them. “I’m not sure what the plan is” or “who knows what actually gonna happen” when it comes to simple decisions are constant from staff due to not having information relayed to them.","Nothing of note","I feel that some ideas /suggestions are dismissed to quickly .","I actually need some education about the conflict resolution policy. I would be interested to know.","I think Oryana Management is fair and open","there are 2 sets of rules those for the staff and those for Admin. Staff is held to a much higher standard than Admin.","I have know idea or experience.","Better communication with employees","As previously stated, the current Co-op management practices do not reflect the goals and values originally listed in the handbook. I believe recent changes made by upper management has created a very different work environment than what was originally intended and displayed to the public. It breaks my heart to see the changes being made, it no longer feels like a community-centered workplace, it feels like we are here to make as much money as possible with little regard for the impact on employees. I believe there need to be serious changes made to the new points policy for attendance, sick leave, maternity leave, and health insurance. It is unfair for the upper management to make decisions based on numbers, and not based on employee feedback and what it is actually like working in the store.","It feels as if Management and employees are on two different planes.  Management should consult employees more on how things are done.  Employees actually are using the processes put in place and know more about what works and what doesn’t.","We have changed management recently and it has been a horrible experience.","I feel as though, even when hearing about things that are off putting, or decisions being made. Management appears to listen and understand what you're saying, but they won't resolve or look over the event or situation. I also feel like management is doing what's best for them in these certain moments, when we could get extra help or a recheck. certain things that I believe we struggle in, there is clear options of things to do but it doesn't work, when things aren't being rechecked or reworked through.","The GM does her job very well.","Regardless of what's said by members of upper management, there is a very solid line between upper management and floor workers, even upper management and department managers. There is a huge lack of communication when management makes decisions, and when problems arise with equipment or the workspace and requests are made with frequency over the course of months, only to be dismissed or lost in a chain of communication somewhere. Recently, the Panther coffee was taken away, we were not given a reason, it wasn't communicated to Malu first, and nobody informed the Panther representatives either. Customers have complained, employees have complained, the representative was confused, and we couldn't provide answers to anyone. There have been several other cases in the past year in which we've voiced problems to management, and either nothing has been done, or their solution has been more harmful to our workflow and provided more issues. I am more frequently uncomfortable around members of upper management than otherwise, have had more miscommunications than solid, productive conversations, and have continued to feel as though my work and my personage is alien to them outside of the vague aesthetic given in passing small talk. Regardless of upper management's assistance on the floor, with bagging and sometimes stocking in grocery, it feels as though they don't know the nuances of the store's operations outside of numbers, and that disappoints me with my expectations of how a co-op should operate and *be* operated.","The atmosphere at Oryana has shifted to a less comfortable work place","The biggest change in the last two years has been our new GM and the new policies that has occurred along with the steps to handle situations. It used to be regular for employee's to have meeting with the management, owners, and other employees to help and fix issues within the business, but that has changed. We have seen management loss tempers quickly, make sexual endeavors toward employees, place employee's in extreme situations, do not follow the handbook on how to handle issues, and do not practice helping when staff is run thin. Our management is open to change but not for employees, the values, or community unfortnly it has become all about profit in any way that works. There has been many mangers and HD leaving due to the changes that have been made and are unable to stay due to the harm they feel they cause by staying. Employees issues are not handled without it becoming a huge conflict for days, weeks, or months without anything being truly done. There is a huge lack in communication between management and the employers. One example that just happened in the last week was all the refrigerators and freezers got changed without letting the employees who deal with moving item's consistently not knowing where it went, having less space despite being told to order more items, and having employees move there department items in the moment despite having tasks to do. Its become a hostile work environment due to the new management leadership.","I believe to the best of their ability they try to be fair","NOT SURE","follow through / accountability / communication from store manager and floor managers is low.  bringing concerns often feels brushed off","Employee handbook dress code is not enforced. Name tags are not enforced, and I have seen daisy duke shorts worn.","I feel very comfortable bringing anything to the gm of my department. I have a harder time bringing things to the male shift lead in the cafe. He sometimes had a self righteous attitude that is hard to get passed and made me feel inferior. It was partly why I was so ready to move to a different part of the department and away from cafe.","There is not enough transparency for any one employee to understand the handling of these things in practice. Some safety concerns are listened to, others are not. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to why.","We have all noticed you like to ask our opinion then just do what you said you were going to do in the first place.  Nobody cares! Don't waste a bunch of time asking about something when in your mind you have a plan. Just say this is what you want and what you are going to do.","I cannot comment on the conflict resolution processes involved as I have yet to experience them personally","My immediate superiors in the culinary department have for at least the last 10 plus years have been nothing but supportive and encouraging to me and my work ethic.  I have mixed feelings about the decision making of upper management. \n However, when giving my agree/disagree statements I felt that I had to lump all managers upstairs/downstairs together, and this may affect any straight forward answer I fear. \nMost specifically I hate the new point system. It exempts salary paid folk and it punishes things people can’t control, even if they call. Hit a deer, wreck the car, get a point for being absent. Had a power outage, had to wait an hour to leave house, called work, get a point for being late \nYou’re punishing the wrong people and it’s an uncomfortable feeling waking up in the morning."]},{"Question":"26.

Either way I think the issues spread beyond these stated categories.\n\nI feel we have wonderfully clear communication with our department managers but outside of the department things go dark quickly. I hear about employees being fired or quitting through internal gossip before any posted notices or newsletters. Usually department changes are brought up as an order without considering the people of the department and without any clearly stated reason. There’s a huge difference between communicating that something is happening, and explaining why something is happening. Our employees thrive in trusted collaboration not taking orders and appeasing demands because somebody said so.","The only people involved in meetings are department managers and not the employees doing the work on the floor, like me.

We adjust product and they have us put the product back. we show them the issue but do not do anything to improve issue.","Big changes are almost always last minute and with no collaboration between the upper level people deciding things and the actual departments being affected by these decisions. Many of these changes are often not flushed out and create so much unnecessary headaches and production issues that a more collaborative approach is needed, especially as we approach Thanksgiving.","There are kudos in the Oracle and in the form of periodic staff luncheons which are appreciated.  It would be good if the manager also shared positive feedback on a regular basis.  My experience has been that it is only the negative that has been shared.  My experience has always been that when you sit down with a someone for their performance review there should be no new information. It's a hard job for everyone and more of a personal touch would be good.  I personally hear it from other department staff e.g. \"I appreciate you\" and that is so nice to hear especially after a series of grumpy customers.","Assuming we know something but never telling us","Some floor managers do not understand time management in some depts, such as getting an order done for customers, an empty space we are trying to fill before we open.","We all know UNFI runs the co-op.

There seems to be a lack of communication between the front end and culinary department.","Communication between management and employees is weak.  Almost never brought in on decisions that affect us.","My manager is very difficult to work with and communicate effectivly.","All I need to know is conveyed in a timely manner.","Thr afternoon huddle generally feels bad to go to for me, personally, as I generally don't feel like I have 10-15 min to hear about the problems front end is having. It is nice to see people from the other departments but the story circle feels very tedious when I have obligations to either tenth streets counter or mine.","Again, any attempts at communication with upper management feel null at best, or more frequently outright mal. \n\nI.E.; we've been asking for shelving units to improve the customer interface and organization in the cafe for well over a year, making constant notes that upwards of a dozen customers a day are either confused about where they're supposed to go to order or pick up, or are purposefully trying to skip the line by ordering over the back counter, interrupting our workflow and disrespecting other customers in the process. It took months for the issue to even be addressed, and the solution was halfhearted and has only made the issue worse, now customers are attempting to pick up and walk away with our display plants, or attempt to reach over them to try and take their drink while we bring it to the pickup counter. I've been bringing complaints about other user interfacing issues that I've collected from a decade working in cafe settings, plus my experience working adjacent to gallery and museum interfacing, and from customers who have expressed simply that the layout in cafe is poor, the seating area is cold and uncomfortable and often breaking at the seams, and the response is generally just \"thank you for letting us know, we'll see what we can do.\" \n\nWe've had frequent issues with Victor, specifically, I've personally been accused of things he overheard incorrectly, or did not have full information on--he tried to get me in trouble when my family, who I was living with at the time, used my discount card on a purchase, which by my understanding was why we got extra cards in the first place, he's been accusative of me for immature things that Theo did back before he left, that for some reason I am now assumed to be complicit in, he's made decisions about cafe that have been harmful to both our workflow and our identity as a facet of Oryana's customer experience, he's overridden Malu when she's stood by us on things we're uncomfortable with, and he's entered cafe without announcement or proper dress to handle customers that I am already taking care of. This is an issue I don't feel comfortable bringing up vocally, because among all the other, more immediate ones, nothing's going to change.","Within my department our manger has done an absolutely incredible job at listening to employees, helping to the most extent to fix issues and always have a line of open communication. What she has been able to do and help with she has done. Though management time and time again have gone over her despite her fixing major issues leading to better service. General mangers that run the store do not truly speak to employees and do not actively make changes to help employees. Request's are denied, when there is employee on employee issues rarely anything happens, higher management will harass employees and other mangers just to make sure the new rules will be followed. Management does play a active role in the daily endeavor's by employees and will actually scream(like true screaming and yelling where your ears start to ring) at employees for no reason, make extremely weird, awkward, and sexual comments to employees where people do not feel safe around them. Last thing ill not here is that not many employees are able to attend any of those meetings and management has not helped in changing that despite becoming commonly asked.","Needs a bit of work","I feel there is  always room for improvement","The huddles leave out a lot of staff specifically in the cafe. There is only one shift lead who rarely makes it to an afternoon huddle. They should be more inclusive. West cafe seems to make a lot of decisions on what special items we will featuring and it is poorly related to tenth street staff members. As this has happened several times there is a bit of animosity between the staff members and it’s harder to see the special featured positively","We can always get better at communicating. I think that having SOP for losing important positions within the structure of the organization is very needed. It seems that people quit, and then we are spread very thin waiting to replace them. The people doing the extra work are not compensated for this.","More direct communication would help facilitate understanding between departments and lead to less stepping on each others' toes, so to speak","communication about legitimate concerns are being ignored"]},{"Question":"32. Comments about Compensation?","Comments":["This year we have moved away from merit based raises and not much information was given to us about this change. I was completely blindsided when I received a raise of only 30¢. When I had reached out to HD it was explained to me that really nothing could be done to change this as it was based on a scale where factors like: years employed, and position effected the raise rate that one could be awarded. I was told that I’d likely notice my raises becoming smaller or possibly capping out completely as I was close to the cap out for pay. The only solution offered was to show me the numbers which they work off of when determining raises or to move into a lead position (though, no lead positions in my department have been listed this year!). \n\nThis left me feeling not appreciated or respected for my work at all. The cafe has experienced a lot of hardships in the past year and change. I have not called off of work in almost a full year, I continued to fulfill duties when we were so understaffed that some days I was the only person on shift until 11am, I am open to change within policies, and am generally accommodating to what needs to be achieved even if I feel that it is outside of the means of what should be expected of me. \n\nOverall, I am overworked and underpaid. And when I have shared these concerns over the past year with admin I feel especially blown off and not taken seriously at all.","I have not looked at similar employers' compensation and benefits for a while, so I don't really know how Oryana compares currently. I know I've been told by office staff at medical providers I've been to that we have good benefits, and I believe that. I feel that sometimes the difficulty of juggling multiple areas of the store on command at any time is sometimes underestimated by some management and others who do not have to work in multiple areas.","Pay is not competitive relative to the cost of living in the area and the workloads placed onto hourly paid employees. There are too many upper managers and not enough hourly workers. Store operations/support department is a complete joke and should be abolished starting with the director all the way down.","I think that other employees offer a higher hourly wage if not allowed to collect a substantial amount of tips. I also think the cost of the benefits package makes the hourly wage unlivable and unsustainable to employees with families.","I greatly appreciate the benefits program that Oryana provides.","401k matching is important to me","With the new pay changes instituted last year, I am being paid more initially for my work. However, with an ever increasing workload and pay not being representative of performance, my income will fall behind of other positions in my field.","some store support people were hired in at the same wage that i earn which took me 14 years to achieve and then they don't want to assist me even when they aren't needed in other departments.  we hired (or added) roughly 15 positions of store support and floor managers over the time i've been here and yet the produce team has had any extra help.  when people walk in the store the people working in produce are the first people they see and so we often end up answering their questions and help them find products essentially filling the roles of: customer service, grocery worker, and produce worker and yet we still can't get more labor added to our department to help make things run more efficiently","oryana should guarantee all employees 2 weeks of paid sick time in addition to the current PTO structure. I should be paid a lot more in a leadership role with seniority and the 3% raise cap is pathetic. People hardly have a chance to grow or financial incentive to stay.","The recent raises given out to bring everyone to a \"living wage\" was a good start, but it by no means was enough.  Now raises are not performance based, and the cost of living raise is only 1-3.5%, at that rate it will take 4 years to get to the next dollar amount.  The increased responsibilities and workload are far more than the actual raise in compensation given.","pay is significantly less competitive then when i was hired, but the benefits are good. reducing the raise structure is an insult, telling us the raises are not related to performance to \"reduce the stress related to reviews\" is manipulative corp speak, and again insulting","Unfortunately the health care is really poor here. I’ve cannot afford my monthly medications and am forced to pay out of pocket for my own health insurance. Please consider Blue Cross Blue Shield. Priority health is awful.","We should be compensate more for doing 2 jobs at the register, ringing up and bagging.","The key word is relative to other jobs, that’s a cya clause. It pays good only relative to other grocers in the area, who pay you in cricket wings and mouse droppings.","I know i am paid less than other people in my same position after the same amount of time with no explanation from my boss. \nFavoritism seems commonplace.","I feel like the coop could be a bit more competitive with wage compared to similar marketing jobs in the area, but I find the benefits package to be outstanding and very beneficial.","Our Health Insurance options recently went through an overhaul. Insurance plan pricing increased  with lesser coverage.","Very happy with this aspect of my job. The discount is one of the main drivers for me spending time at oryana outside of my scheduled shifts in order to shop","For those in Traverse City, the minimum recommended wage based on housing and other living expenses and insurance is least 22 an hour. I do not make this much. Other average employees around the store I know do not make this much. If the cooperative sincerely cares about their employees, they will raise our wages. Oryana pays more than some other jobs in the area, but that still does not mean they can't pay us more.","I check job boards constantly because this job is simply not enough to afford an average house or apartment in the area. We write out impressive business figures in the weekly newsletter but I’m getting internal surveys asking me which benefits I care about most (implying that some things need to be cut).  I bring decades of working knowledge about so much more than my job here but I’ve never felt seen beyond being a labor grunt.","There aren't any places that pay a true living wage in the area. There is no way that I could support my family if I had to rely solely on my salary from Oryana. Compensation here might look good when compared to other places, but to believe the Co-op provides a true living wage is inaccurate.","Traverse City is getting more expensive. I understand the challenges of paying everyone more while still keeping co-op grocery prices competitive. Still, I do feel like I'm living paycheck to paycheck...especially with how much health insurance costs.","I BELIEVE THAT COMPENSATION COULD BE BETTER. YES, THE BENEFITS ARE PRETTY GOOD, BUT ARE GETTING SMALLER AS TIME GOES BY. MOST EMPLOYEES HAVE SIDE HUSTLES. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THIS JOB SHOULD BE OUR MAIN FOCUS. THERE IS NO INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO MAKE YOU WANT TO WORK HARD AND PERSEVERE.","The annual cost of living adjustment does not feel like a true raise, as increases in rent, healthcare, and other living expenses often offset any additional income. As a result, it can feel like we're simply maintaining the ability to get by, rather than experiencing meaningful financial growth.","I want to hear more about benefits we will be gaining and how Oryana is investing in employee retention rather than continuing to hear about cuts to our benefits.","I am so happy with the employee benefits and compensation package.","The 25% discount is supreme!","Hopefully, when the time comes for a raise, hourly pay can be negotiated based on the economic 30% rule regarding rent/monthly income.","While the benefit package is amazing compared to other (corporate) jobs, especially the store discount, I do find that the pay is a little lower than what Traverse City expects people to make when reviewing the rent rates in the city as well as compared to some of the wages offered at other stores such as Target/Walmart.","need better pay for where we live and letting us know how you got to you 1% raise discission for some","There is no other business like Oryana in the area, so that is not a fair question. Other grocery stores don't count because they are corporations who are not community oriented. Oryana is supposed to be for the community by the community. Additionally, I think it's inappropriate to have employees rank their benefits and determine which are the least important. It creates a sense of insecurity and lack of trust with upper management because majority of the employees work here for the benefits. The cutting of hours and positions within different departments is also distressing, especially since the coop is seeing growth and profits like never before. It seems like the coop value the community that keeps it alive and running less and less. The day to day employees are by far the most important and recently we are experiencing heavier workloads and decreased staffing. This has led to a decrease in quality in the departments, employee morale, and trust in upper management because profits are valued over people. I sat in an interview once where the interviewer and an HD employee complained and rolled their eyes over how much staffing costs. It felt disrespectful because it implied we don't deserve to be compensated. The coop is larger than ever, the workload is larger than ever, so yes, staffing will cost more than ever. If we can send multiple people on multiple trips across the country, we can afford to keep benefits.","We are a specialty Meat dept that Produces for 2 Stores which means twice the production and more labor for ROP Time/Logs. Other stores do not offer Whole local animal production, Local Beef cutting and Local Chicken cutting, Full-service case as big as ours and diversity of proteins.","All compensation should be public.","I see so much money put into marketing ploys and greenwashing that don't really benefit the customer or staff. Too corporate feeling. Customers comment on these all the time. \"We don't feel like a co-op anymore. It's just sad. \"","Nothing of note","Oryana has many employees who are allowed to do the bare minimum that is expected of them/their position; slow, poor-quality work, general indifference to the efforts of their peers.  This is blatant across all visible departments.  The fact that increases for pay are determined by Human Resources, who has no practical supervision of anyone, is laughable. Increases need to be at the discretion of managers, responsible for overseeing and evaluating the individual's work.  Oryana settles for mediocrity.  Managers have no ability to hold employees accountable, because Oryana does not pay a competitive wage to attract better employees.\n\nOryana sales are up. Oryana prices are rising rapidly.  Inflation is raising all cost-of-living expenses. Oryana leadership has made no communication to employees on how they plan to attract and retain employees in the current economic landscape.  Oryana's employer offered benefits are unaffordable and low quality.  employee pizza parties, sandwiches, and taco bars in lieu of fair wages and benefits, are insulting.","I am monetarily compensated but I am not respected but what I do is not respected by Management.","i believe it is on the lower end of the pay scale for how much hard work gets done. the big save is the discount on groceries if that was not given to us the pay would barely be enough to make ends meet in current times.","The employee discount is an important part of the benefit package","The Cafe workers need to either be paid the same wages as other members of the culinary department, or have the option for customers to leave tips on the card machine. We do not receive adequate tips to make up for the difference in salary, it is unfair for the amount of work done in the Cafe.","More could be offered to older employees taking advantage of Medicare.  There is no supplemental insurance offered to seniors through the benefits program.","The medical and dental benefits are not as good as my previous places of employment. I have to spend a lot more money to cover my needs. There are procedures I cant get done due to the high cost that would have been covered at my previous place of employment.","I am expected to hold special knowledge in wellness products and industry standards that other employees aren't expected to have. I also believe Oryana holds a reputation in the community for taking care of their employees beyond what other grocery stores are expected and Oryana doesnt live up to that standard.","The cost of living is going up so rapidly, it is hard to keep up with basic needs especially with a family.","I know I get paid relatively well for retail but it does feel like I do a LOT of work compared to some people who are also under the employ of oryana. It's Nothing new either for this store or the world but it really does get to me sometimes when I've been sweating and straining and they want to stand yap about whatever.","I have concerns that benefits might reduced. I can't make this job work without them.","This has been an issue purely for my position in cafe, which I've been thinking about for a long time but has become more pressing lately. I'm frustrated with my position being what it is; for how core I seem to be to the operations, and how often that's been verbalized, I'm still only making slightly more than a base hire at, say, Wendy's. I'm placing myself into context, then, around how seriously I should be taking my job when I have so much experience working in coffee, I'm good at keeping the space organized, clean, and presenting issues as they arise so they can be fixed quickly, and I'm not just here for the \"aesthetic\" of cafe work--as a teen's first job; an easy one that requires little attention and allows me to \"look cute\" making latte art and cozy starbucks drinks. I would obviously find that offensive, given the effort I've put in, given that regulars know me by name and know the quality of my work, given that coworkers and managers have voiced that quality as well. \n\nAnd so, in this context, I think it's fair for me to be frustrated with the fact that I'm making the wages that I would be if this were my first job, minus the bonus of card reader tips (which, I should state again, I'm frequently asked about, and customers frequently voice frustration at their exclusion from the system), that I've been placed into a work environment that the previous cafe lead established as deeply unserious, childish even, a place for drama to accumulate and for management to keep a watchful eye. I held things together despite that, worked hard to try and make some amount of respect for myself and my coworkers, I was told I would be taking over his position after leaving, and in his absence the position was taken away completely. I am now making less proportionally than he was hired on for, and yet I have every reason to believe that I am the more qualified worker. I am forced to lower myself to this standard, and feel an obligation to stay purely because I need the benefits. That feels incredibly challenging for me, and the more I consider my place here, the less respectable it feels. I'm stretching myself thin, and it won't even look good on my resume in the future, there is no room for growth unless I switch paths completely.","Despite being told about raises for management or being told it will occur it does not. Many employees that have been here for years make far less than just starting jobs despite usually being some of the hardest workers. The benefits over the last year has changed. Many individuals ae unable to get life saving meds for medical issues, have severe debt due to medical bills despite paying for the top tier benefits, and many have lost benefits as well.","I am thankful for the benefits offered to me. I do not know what other businesses do in the area.","I work a service role in the cafe, yet Oryana doesn't allow for digital tips. In my role, I am working a normal service job, which means running all day, with little break, in a highly trained position. My role is severely under compensating me.","This is hard question to answer as I have recently changed job titles. I did not feel fairly compensated for my role in the cafe. I do feel that my pay rate is more fair now that I have transferred to the bakery.","I am not compensated properly for the complexity of my work. Especially given my seniority and how dynamic my days look week to week, depending on who quits or who needs to be trained. I used to think our benefits could not be beat, however that looks to be changing. Insurance coverage is not what I expected in past years, which I think is a main reason most people work here.","It's one of the only reasons I stay.","Food has become so expense and utilities too. I work another part time job to help. \nThats why just in general pay isn't keeping up with my daily living. It's paycheck to paycheck.\nOryana I'm sure is above the general area pay and without Oryana I would be struggling more.\nSo, the fair pay issue is a gray issue."]},{"Question":"41. Comments about Store Operations?","Comments":["Floor management seems unsure of actual tasks that are helpful to the teams","Store operations director is arrogant, disrespectful, and actively retaliates against hourly employees that dare to bring any sort of feedback or perspective that differs from their own. Store operations are a complete and total disaster with floor managers essentially wandering around most of the day, stopping only to bag a few groceries or open a cash register on occasion. Store operations/support department is a complete and total failure, the entire thing should be redesigned to actually support hourly employees.","Our equipment has needed maintenance for months and that has been voiced and documented for (2+) months, meaning the customers have been receiving less-than product because our equipment is not operating at the standard it should be. The walk-in freezer has frequent dangerous slippery patches that cause a safety hazard. There is not clear or timely communication between departments, if at all. I think floor managers do the best they can with what is flung at them, but the issues are from higher management positions.","i love the floor managers, shoutout to lauren and jordan","I think that this comes back to employee feedback and requests. I know many of us have asked for safety measures that management simply refuses or thinks we don't need. This includes parking lot improvements, cameras on the building exterior.","the recent transformation of the produce cooler into storage for everyone was handled poorly. the only people that were in the know of this were the decision makers. Zero communications with those are directly affected. It's happening therefore suck it up, Victor needs another office.

There are a couple of floats that create more work for the department than they do help, but the majority are wonderful and the floor managers are just as supportive. They’re like a traveling department manager when mine isn’t around. I feel safe going to floor managers with concerns","Sometimes they are not available when you need them .","Ergonomic and long-term health impacts are not considered, same as most retail spaces. Staff needs to be allowed options to sit, stand, and walk throughout the day to avoid injury to the back, feet, etc- all departments should be issued folding stools, especially front end","I've watched store operations arbitrarily enacting additional changes for the sake of change without considering the current operations, successful or otherwise. In some cases this undermines my ability to effectively perform my own job. In one or two instances the tools required to complete a task have been taken or removed.","As far as safe food hygiene, i know if you work in a kitchen you are not supposed to wear any fragrance or perfume, yet i know there are people in the kitchen who do because it so strong when they walk past. A huge turn off. I avoid the food in the kitchen.","At times there is a disconnect in the flow of communication between marketing staff and other departments, but as a department, marketing is very understanding of the need to be flexible while awaiting decisions and communication from other departments. Our marketing \"supervisor\" consistently bridges those communication gaps, managing the team and our needs successfully.","Equipment failures have often gone by the way side. I feel there is a break down in communication. Why does it take 5 e-mails and 8 phone calls to get something fixed?","There’s a need for stronger communication between store departments, Receiving, and Admin. Sometimes information doesn’t flow smoothly between these groups, which can lead to delays or confusion. Improving the consistency of communication across these areas would help operations run more efficiently and reduce the chance of things being missed.","I think the store is run well overall. I notice some inefficiencies in specific departments but I am also aware that these are known to management and are in the process of being addressed","The floor managers are the true heroes of the store. I am happy to have the support of the floor managers on any given shift. They have paid me more mind and support than any upper management employee has ever talked to me and supported me.","I don’t have access to any of the computer programs used daily in my job. I need to request system changes constantly for weeks to get them addressed. It feels like a lot of operations is being gate-kept by a select few people upstairs whose time is spread too thin across all stores/locations to be able to address everything that needs attention.\n\nOur freezers have gone down or experienced severe issues multiple times in my relatively short time at Oryana. Information about the failing sensors and alarm codes was directly communicated to operations ahead of failure and it was dismissed as if we didn’t know what we were talking about. I can’t begin to explain in this text box how insulting it is to be treated this way when my daily actions are in service to this company and with the greater community in mind.","sometimes the break room is a bit dirty.\nI clean up after myself but sometimes its a bit messy.","I think the Floor Manager position is critical to daily operations and am grateful for their work.","Jamie and Amanda have done a great job elevating the culture of safety at the stores.

THEY ARE MISSING A LOT OF THE TIME.","Occasionally there are shopping carts full of products pulled after an endcap change, these shopping carts are left in the back sometimes for weeks for us to maneuver around. Generally they are left by people that don’t do much else back there and are not affected by it. There is also a lot of new products ordered that take up space and boats we really need at times.","There are so many moving parts to the store operations, and I think Oryana is particularly good at addressing issues. I also see Ops looking ahead to potential situations and trying to anticipate issues before they become problematic.","Sometimes -especially in the evenings - I feel that staff support is stretched thin.  Floats might be needed in 3 areas so that leaves 2 areas suffering.  Floor Managers run around responding to a crisis situation and may not have the time to address the basics.  Sometimes the store does not look as tidy as it could look and I'm surprised when customers comment that the store always looks clean. There are times when it seems like Floor Managers do a lot of \"standing around\".  Perhaps this is in preparation for the aforementioned \"crisis\".  When I first started I witnessed customers being talked to by Management and/or Floor Managers.  I think customers truly appreciate this and again, this is something that could (will) set us apart from Whole Foods.  A little hand holding is not a bad thing.","I don't see a lot of this","I'd like more training on emergency response procedures for violence, fire, flood etc.","Floor managers don't do much at all for my department.","Nothing of note","sometimes the lack of management is  a problem in getting a answer to a problem ,Leaving us to solve it on our own.\nMost of the time the communication is good ,but once in a while it is sadly lacking.\nit seems that the night shift is less effective than the day shift, Maybe because of lack of higher managers not present.","Floor managers could help the store a lot more. many times they don't look for places to help or they take help away when task are half down","Love the support that floor managers provide us","Technology in the culinary department should be upgraded more regularly, the use of household blenders/juicers in the cafe makes it difficult to preform tasks efficiently and ultimately end up costing the Co-op more when they break down frequently from overuse.","Not all floor managers are good at giving support in my department.","Overall the work place is clean and physically saft but there are emotional safety concerns.","Most floor managers seem to be effective; one or two individuals fall short. IMHO","the west side entry way would look better minus all that backstock piled up there.","I have concerns about the number of floor managers vs staff on the department teams. All the floor managers are very nice but it is not a replacement for department staff. They are being paid a higher wage but are not as effective as department staff.","Floor managers deserve to be making so much more than they are, I have so much respect for their position and capacity.","There is a huge disconnect between departments, how to handle situations, and what's happening around the store. The safety and food handles is highly regulated and does a good job. It has been a normal thing for things to break down and new item's needed that do not get ordered due to money despite it being a sole part of a department. For example in the cafe we've had out coffee maker broke down for months not being able to ground beans as well as it should but despite asking numerous times it has not been fixed(even though they said they called them and tell us each time we ask they will arrive next week to fix it).","Overall it's good, I think communication lacks a bit","I would like to see the employees take more pride in their job by keeping areas clean, stocked and ready for customers. The cafe seating is a neglected area, as well as the check out lanes, belts are not cleaned, dusty underneath registers. When front end staff are not busy with customers they should be doing things to tidy up the area, especially the cafe seating area, as they are right there and can see if it needs a clean up; wipe down tables, replenish napkins, sweep, attend to trash.  \nFood rotation on the shelves is also crutial and something that I feel is not done enough.","Cafe staff needs to wash hands more regularly.","FM's often just hang out or chat.  I don't feel supported by them.","Replace the blender in the cafe! It barely blends and is very very loud.","It seems a lot of floor managers are glorified baggers and bottle return runners.","Would like training for a lockdown for front and back areas."]},{"Question":"47. Comments on Operations?","Comments":["It feels as though both stores operate differently, and there is a divide in how they handle things at tenth versus west.","other store feels more corporate and uncomfortable","I don't think west and 10th need to be as interconnected as management strives for. I don't know what's happening at West or the staff at West and don't need to.","this has improved so much","I have no idea what happens at 10th St.","people who shop at 10th st don't want it to be like our other location, they want 10th st to stay as organic and local as possible.  west location people shopping there don't care as much about organic as they do prices","throughout the culinary alignment process, there have been many times where the 10th street way of doing things is presented as the correct way to do something. I wish we could meet in a neutral ground and discuss putting together something new instead of conforming to some antiquated way of running things.","i don't know when to expect things from west like cheese or smoked turkey, if the cafe calls and asks i don't have information from them. if my department lead calls west, they can't even get an answer some days.","10th and West are still in polar opposite worlds but I am starting to see them get closer. Without some positions at 10th, I assume this is the reason for the recent decline in communication.","I dont know if the stores talk to each other at all, they might as well be separate stores","While we try our best in Marketing to be at Tenth and West equally, it is difficult at times when our \"home\" (computer, workspace, desk, etc.) is at Tenth, and meeting rooms and spaces are at times booked at West.","Operation Managers at both stores do not openly share information with the departments affected.","Operations in the 10th store should be more aligned with the structure used at West rather than the current setup at 10th. For example, receiving duties and communication between receiving and department managers need improvement to ensure smoother workflows and accountability.","I answered no opinion for most of these because my work is largely independent of the other store and I have little or no communication or collaboration with the other location","We have no inter-department collaboration or communication outside of paging/customer service calls. We are oftentimes told last minute about how we need to do something for the other store. For example, our bakery had to make desserts for both stores last holiday season without any advance notice, preparation, or additional support staff. \n\nFloaters almost never work in the culinary department even if we are short staffed. Floor managers never come in our department unless there’s a customer service issue.","I don't like the idea of aligning the two stores in every way. There are things that just don't work here the way they work at 10th Street.","wish there was some type of inventory system to better track what we have on hand as well as check what the other store has without multiple calls to the other store throughout my shift.\nIt would also be nice to know what products they stock that we don't .","I personally feel the burden of better coordinating with departments. I know there are regular leadership meetings, intended to coordinate between stores. Still, I overlook some communication needs at times.","THE STORES CANNOT BE THE SAME. THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE DIFFERENT AND EQUIPMENT IS DIFFERENT. WE CAN BE SIMILAR AND STILL BE A CO-OP, BUT A LOT HAS GONE BY THE WAYSIDE AS FAR AS CO-OP QUALITY. FOR INSTANCE, THERE IS A LOT OF CONVENTIONAL PRODUCE HERE. I HAVE TO SHOP AT THE OTHER STORE OR ELSEWHERE TO FIND QUALITY.","I depend on the weekly Oracle for what's going on at West.","Besides reading about things in the Oracle, and some word of mouth, I don't know much at all about what goes on at 10th on a day to day basis.","we aren't told a lot here","I see departments working toward alignment, but I doesn't affect my work very much.","The lack of ability to check inventory at either store without physically calling somebody is absurd. All inventory should be searchable in a database from customer service and that inventory should be updated in real time based on the POS system. Is it 2025 or 1925?","We are often caught off guard with customers coming in asking about what they saw on social media or that there is an event that we were not informed on. We look inept at meeting the customer needs and questions.","Nothing of note","I would love to know more about the other store.","Between the culinary department at 10th street and West there seems to be little communication by managers to employees about the SOP's of the counterpart department.","We could get slack and communicate and collaborate between stores and employees.","I have received several complaints about 10th street. The ones I hear the most are, they aren't friendly, they don't greet or even say hi. When a customer asks a question, they aren't as attentive, making the customers feel heard. I also hear it a lot from both stores, some people don't check if people have memberships.","It seems like West is prioritized for staff and resources.","I personally do not need to know what is going on at the other store unless it affects my portion of a department, witch is rare but is always communicated. As far as I am aware communication is good between the stores.","Overall things are improving with working together with the other store.","There should be a cafe lead at both stores to help with communication and there should be two at tenth street where production and sales are higher. The staff truly needs it. Things get lost in the scuffle of the higher ups. They don’t really work in the cafe. We need more in the know from our shift lead at 10th","I communicate well with my counterpart at West. I think we are continuing to improve communication and cooperation between both locations. It is encouraging to see us moving in that direction the longer time goes on.","Communication with tenth Street is not a priority to me, and only occurs when it needs to (e.g. if UNFI messed up and gives us their shipment, or if one of the stores desperately needs goods that the other store has aplenty)"]},{"Question":"56. Comments about Department Operations?","Comments":["Often I feel that I am bringing up the same concerns in my department on a consistent, weekly basis. \n\nWithin the cafe each station has a daily checklist to refer to (ideally filled out) that is often disregarded. I open the whole cafe every morning, alone - which is fine because I have always done that! Closes seems to be sloppy consistently. I often spend 30 minutes just cleaning and restocking and taking note of what hasn’t been done for my department manager. There is little communication left for me of what my coworkers were able to finish or not, so then I must take stock of everything too. This all happens before I can focus on opening the cafe. \n\nIt seems that my department manager takes this seriously and brings it up often to others of what is expected in the cafe but she is often disregarded. I know this because things may get better for a week or two but return to the state it was very quickly.","My direct co-workers are amazing and we respect each other. We communicate fluidly within the department and highly value each other's work ethic and time. Department leads help and communicate as much as they are able to, which is appreciated.","More communication between staff within the department instead of top down would be beneficial. Some employees are much less effective than others and seem as equally effective.","we don't have meetings in our department. I believe this is problematic in multiple departments though. we are expected to move such high volumes of food (and it only increases annually) that the thought of a weekly (bi-weekly, monthly, etc) meeting that would take 5-10 minutes is too much of an interruption to our daily operations. I've worked in multiple departments, same issues in both. I have friends that work for KEEN and they have weekly meetings on wednesday mornings and everyone checks in no matter where they are. They are short and concise meetings to make sure that tasks/projects are proceeding as planned.","one on one meetings work best for me. i don't think dept. meetings are that helpful for me","the expectations for certain people are much much lower than the expectations for others. our goal seems to be to do more with less and to align with 10th.","My department manager makes everyone feel valuable, appreciated, and respected.  The upper management seems to be lording over everyone, and not making anyone feel appreciated, or respected.","my leads and coworkers in my department are generally great, but we don't have the resources we need and everyone is stressed out more than necessary most of the time","Others come to me as if I am a lead, tho I am not, and it gives me a feeling of respect. The consistency is not the same for all employees, but *nearly* all. There are a couple of employees who are not talked to about their efficiency in task completion, not corrected on cellphone use, prolonged conversations, or other practices that are in place to set the team up for success.  (Condensing milk crates/chips backstock, putting away cardboard, running the baler when full, etc…)","Some co workers are not doing their jobs and they leave the work area constantly . \nThere is some co workers creating Gossip, drama and  not providing a Healthy environment.","Haven’t been in this particular department long enough to form an opinion","We are very like-minded and connected to our overall goals as a marketing department. Very satisfied with this overall.","department wide we are working hard with the tools provided.","We have had a lot of changes to departmental leadership in the short time I have been working in it. This has brought with it challenges, as one would expect, but I am confident they are being addressed and I am hopeful that we will continue to move in the right direction","I feel extremely welcomed and loved by my department manager and my department coworkers. I feel useful on the team, and I can see results of my hard work pay off in my department. We are good at communicating and I know exactly what I need to do and how when I come in. My department manager carries the team on her back, and I am extremely thankful to her and her dedication to this department.","Our department is filled with some of the hardest working people I know who continually show up and bring their best. We don’t talk about goals much as a department or as a store for that matter. The only things I hear in the newsletter are when sales are higher than expected or lower than expected—it’s an almost useless perspective to anyone who isn’t on the board or in our financial department.","The new department manager gives me hope for effective changes. The last department meeting we had was a waste of time. It was a review of things we already know and virtually nothing new. There was no time set aside for questions or concerns. Decisions are all made by others and I have no say in them.","I can honestly say I really enjoy my team. I look forward to collaborating with my colleagues.","MY DIRECT BOSS IS FANTASTIC. ONE OF THE BEST TWO BOSSES I HAVE EVER HAD. IF THINGS NEED TO GET DONE, SHE IS ELBOWS DEEP TO HELP IT GET DONE.","My department managers are great at communicating what needs to be done and needs to be improved in production.","My department is very well managed.","I have never attended a department meeting - I am unsure of any that have taken place since I have been here.  I know with staff's varying schedules it would be challenging but the outcome would be positive if meetings could happen regularly. Co-workers have always been helpful.  During the day there is an increase in additional bagging assistance due to the administration being scheduled to do so.  In the evenings it would be nice if someone were scheduled to assist especially during OAM or holiday times.","In my 8-plus months in this department I have never had a department meeting.","Store support doesn't have meetings with floats so I don't have many opinions on this.","This is a grocery store let's chill for a minute and not take this so seriously. At the same time some of the stuff that goes on is absurd. Good thing this is only a grocery store.","Communication about departmental goals and metrics would be very helpful. Lacking at this time.","Nothing of note","we have little or no department meetings.","I can’t say enough about working within Grocery, I really appreciate everyone on the team.","department leads have meetings but as cashiers we don't have that opportunity.","I believe the SOP's need to be regulated more closely for Cafe workers to produce consistent products to customers, I have noticed that each employee has slightly different ways of making products, which inherently isn't bad, but makes for inconsistent products. I believe there should be monthly or bi-monthly meetings with the manager and employees to go over the correct ways to make drinks and food to make sure we are giving customers the best experience possible.","I have no department meetings.  I was adequately trained at the start and have had to learn on the job.  It just seems inefficient.","Our manager sets clear expectations, sets the pace, and gives on-going feedback & communication. Much appreciated!","It is a manager issue. I work very well with my coworkers but we have an overbearing, disorganized manager who is out of touch with the needs of the department and doesn't seek any input from us. This person makes changes to our schedules without notice and expects us to bend our lives with the needs of the department instead of working with us and creating a schedule that is balanced and equitable. She's also harassed me for my clothing choice and attempted to touch me inappropratly","My department does a terrific job at communicating, making sure needs are meet, always helping each other if able, and always checking up on each other. It has been unfortunate but the culinary crew are always doing catch-up due to the lack of employees due to the loss of jobs. That being said its been difficult to make new higher goals within our department despite everyone putting in 120% every day.","Our department is small, we rely on each other daily to make sure things go smoothly","a very supportive dept manager who works hard on the floor with the team to ensure a solid department and focus on our goals.  he is approachable and welcoming and always letting us know we are appreciated.  that matters","I feel much more appreciated and included in the bakery. I did not feel that way about the cafe. Once again a second lead is needed. It is very hard to get other coworkers in the cafe to do dishes.","I feel that there are people who need to step up and put more work into their work. This can only be done if my Department manager has the tools to so.  If hands are tied, or we don't want to hurt feelings (Being firm and letting people know that their performance is not good and they need to be faster, cleaner, and/or do the job as described in their title. This is different than being condescending and cruel), then real progress can never be made."]},{"Question":"67. Comments about Human Resource Practices?","Comments":["This was about two years ago when a lead was removed from the cafe for transphobic, racist, and aggressive behavior. Three people, including myself, were directly effected. The lead was just transferred to another store, which always seemed not sufficient to me if we have zero tolerance.\n\nCustomers that exhibit these behaviors get banned pretty quickly after investigation.","Human resources is actively trying to punish hourly workers with the ridiculous points system. Attrition and thinning out hourly paid employees to make room for over paid, lazy executive managers seems to be the primary focus of Human resources here at Oryana. Disciplinary policies are enforced inconsistently and with a complete lack of regard for the struggles that actual hourly working employees have in their lives. Human resources rarely provides clear and consistent information to hourly employees, frequently even disregarding state and federal labor laws. The head of Human Resources at Oryana is an absolute disgrace and should be terminated.","The co-op has explicitly neglected appropriate response to harassment on multiple occasions.","I feel that they tend to be closed off to individual needs and circumstances. I also think they need to be less corporate with their delivery and more contextual giving information and answers toquestions.","i've been retaliated against and it almost lead to my termination.  i've had a manager walk away from while i was trying to communicate to them on more than one occasion.  i've seen managers do things that would have resulted in termination but had no effect on them.  i know coworkers who were let go who were dedicated employees that were dealing with mental health stuff. etc.","i dont trust oryana to honor the no retaliation policy, oryana holds a grudge and it isnt subtle.","i really don't trust HR and general co-op management's judgement","Recent handbook changes are not clearly defined and subjective. I feel like they are used differently on a per-employee basis depending on how the employee is valued.","No comment, thanks for being awesome and supportive, HD!","None. I think HD is run well and I have no concerns and see no areas for improvement in that department","There are no channels of communication that don’t involve my personal identifying information or require direct confrontation.","There is no transparency with this. I do not know what transpires when people exercise their right to speak out. The section in the handbook about PTO and ESTA is terribly unclear. I don't understand why we are required to use PTO any time we take time off and no one has been able to explain it to me clearly.","I want to compliment the HD Department for always being thoughtful and available","Certain people get special treatment. Again, this is just a grocery store and we need to chill. I think we really should be having more fun. But they're definitely is kind of a very weird stuck up parasite in your brain kind of vibe coming from 10th Street.","I feel disability is not a popular enough diversity to be acknowledged or respected at Oryana","Nothing of note","I feel like there is sometimes a change in attitude and therefore a change in the workplace environment when issues are brought to the attention of HR representatives. There seems to be a lot of gossip around issues that are brought to HR between upper management and department managers.","I've been sexually harassed by two separate female managers and the company needs a policy for this type of harassment to avoid it in the future. I had an abrupt schedule change that harms my family and puts my job in jeopardy imediatly following and incident where I stood up for myself to my manager.","Putting obvious regional or local labor pool shortages aside, I would hope that Oryana is consistently hiring the best person for the job, not trying to fill DEI quotas that could have a detrimental effect on the overall operations that we all strive to improve.","The cafe has been reporting on a harassment case recently, and there were several retaliatory steps taken by the person in blame that have not been addressed, including accusing us of \"inappropriate drawings\" that I was told were left by Theo months and months ago and evidently only this person knew about, messes left in cafe during coverage after we explicitly asked them not to cover, rumors spread among coworkers tarnishing my reputation. We've spoken about this already, but I need to be clear that it's middle-schooler behavior and I'm incredibly frustrated that it's continuing to go on despite so many people coming out against it. I verbalized my fear of this retaliation, even, I said I wouldn't want to stay at my job if it continued. And it's continued! I have good reason to believe that if I were treating a coworker this way, I would have been fired a long time ago, and I think that's a valid frustration to voice over management's handling of the situation over the course of the last month.","HD for the most part does take most things seriously if its the law, however when its just in the hand book it is not taken seriously. It has been a common thing for harassment to get to a point of food being messed with, nothing being done, and many things nothing will happen.","Great team","There is noticeable regular microaggressions to people of color, which is known to cause stress in the workplace. Most non-white employees have left the position or have been fired, at a higher rate than white counterparts.","Everyone in HR does an excellent job in my view","I have not been happy with the mediation process involving HR in the past year or two. It seems that if you do not have written or recorded proof of what has been said to you by your supervisor, HR will always believe them and make the employee appear to be in the wrong. I am also not a fan of the handbooks terrible explanation of the \"point\" system for attendance. I see a lot of people getting caught out this winter due to inclement weather because of it. It is an unfair system."]},{"Question":"77. Comments about Training and Development?","Comments":["I have seen others get told they cannot be promoted for a reason I believe being that the co-op would not want to fill the previous positions spot. It can feel like Oryana would rather hire someone entirely new rather than give a current employee a promotion.","The cafe has not had a lead position made available for growth in over a year.","Outside hires with little to no experience are given preference over in house promotions. Frequently, workers are expected to train their manager.","New employees are no longer shown around or introduced. My job description has not been properly updated since Lucky's. Potential for promotion is limited and given the lack of communication between all of management, would not be sought out anyway.","Part time employees need to be seen as more valuable members. Full time employees are the only ones with the ability to have job growth and meaningful positions. My education and experience is undervalued because as a part time employees I'm limited.","I felt that the staff hand book orientation could have been skipped. We should sign a paper saying we have gotten and looked over the handbook. Save everyone time.","floor managers could use more training before being on their own","i have no idea what im supposed to be doing in the big picture, it changes frequently and depending on who you ask. Culinary leads are loaded up with so much shit to do that there are inevitably going to be things slipping through the cracks. I have no idea what management is looking for from me and it feels like it may change at any moment. Sometimes it is hard to be confident in what I am telling people because policy can be wishy washy and 2 people can be on totally different pages as to what we are doing.","I’m in love with the idea of a promotion, but I see more positions being taken away as folk leave rather than reposted for applications.","One of the goals on my last evaluation was to train in wellness during August. No training has ever been done. Seems like i am given unrealistic goals to complete when my boss puts me on other tasks.","I do NOT like the evaluation process in my department.  There should be NO surprises in an evaluation, and I do not like that the evaluation has a negative approach to my performance.  Rather than being told what a good job I'm doing, I feel as though my boss would rather search far and wide for anything I may be doing wrong, then puts it on my evaluation, and spends time on that, rather than building me up.  I walk out feeling like, \"gee, why didn't they say something BEFORE the evaluation?\" Or \"gee, didn't know they felt that way\".  Just isn't a good experience, and I dread an evaluation, even though I know I'm doing a good job.","I have found Oryana's employee training and development to be very insightful and helpful.","As of recently the annual wage increase (raise) has decreased significantly.","Job description and Responsibilities should be available somewhere on Paylocity to look at for future references.","i am often told to \"just do better\" with no additional guidance","I have never received an evaluation so I do not have much input there. I notice the trainings mentioned in the Oracle regularly but I am usually unclear on what exactly they are for. It would be very helpful to have a brief description for each training in the Oracle rather than just the title.

Also more education on alcohol sales - clear direction on store policy.","Seems like promotions have totally stopped.","Nothing of note","Evaluations should be performance based otherwise there is no reason to strive above the bare minimum that is the job description.","As previously stated, I believe there could be more training and communication in regards to SOP's in the culinary department to reduce the variety in how food is produced. Especially with the new changes being made, it is important to inform both new and old employees of how to correctly produce new products.","We need to cross train within the department and there could be more opportunities for advanced learning if we weren't so overwhelmed and under staffed. Our new manager has cut hours and created a skeleton crew with little to no overlap between shifts.","I can see the potential to be promoted here, just, I don't really see it happen that often. I think out of the whole time I have been here two people have gotten a better position. Which to me seems like, I find that kind of weird. I feel like if we are promoting growth in departments, there should be more growth shown through the store.","The biggest hindrance to the class based approach here at oryana is the community room is not built to have a bunch of people in there without the oven vent  hood turned on. As a result the co2 levels spike and everyone is falling asleep while we're listing to a presentation.","I understand the receptibilities of my job however there is a huge lack in training portion throughout the store.

This is a reason behind my choice to move to the bakery. I feel limited in the cafe and that my skills were more useful elsewhere","You will not be promoted in this organization if you don't have prior experience in management, regardless of your skill set.

She corrects improper behavior, attitudes, or procedures without making anyone feel bad.  She respects everyone in the department. and it shows.","my supervisors are great, but i feel they have all the accountability in running my department, but very little actual authority due to upper management's micromanagement and lack of respect for their expertise","My supervisor is THE BEST!!! he has gotten much better at telling me when I’m doing a good job, so I greatly appreciate that.","Havent been in this department long enough to form an opinion","Too early to tell.","My boss Hunter i dont think has ever told me good job, thanks for the hard work, or anything along those lines. He does not create any motivation, does not create any kind of team moral, is cold and inconsiderate. Seems to not respect me or include or value me as a member of the “team”.","My main problem with my supervisor is that they do ZERO positive moral boosting.  There's never any positive feedback, they do not let you know they appreciate you, they do not make me feel valued.  In fact, I think they take the positive stuff for granted but like to look for mistakes instead.  It's frustrating.","My supervisor is fantastic both as a supporter and leader. Highly satisfied.","My supervisor is committed to improving our department and has communicated an openness to input from myself on how that can be achieved. I feel that my supervisor takes this aspect of the job seriously and I have confidence in their ability to source solutions from our department and implement them competently and in a timely manner","I have never felt more supported or understood by a supervisor in my life. I know my supervisor sees my potential and gives me the space they are allowed to help me grow. I think we are often both limited in the ways we are able to bring the best out of Oryana.","What I have experienced so far with our new DM has been good. I'm hopeful for some good changes in the future. I would like to see more fairness in scheduling. At a store where we are open weekends and evenings, everyone should have to work at least some of those hours. If they \"can't\", they should not be hired.","SHE WILL DO ANYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE OR HELP ANYONE WITH ANYTHING. ALWAYS WITH NO DISCRIMINATION AND ALWAYS WITH A SMILE.","My supervisors are willing to work side by side with me. They both let me know what is expected of me and push me to do better and become better at my job.","My direct supervisor is doing an incredible job at supporting and advocating for us and I feel like we have the healthiest balance with our jobs that we've had and it's thanks to her leadership.","Mixed bag on the whole. Sometimes problems are pointed out on a day to day, other times they are noted but not told until months later.","I do hear consistently from Leads in my department so if that is the intent of my supervision then I would agree with all comments above.  Feedback from the Manager is lacking.","Amanda is great. She firmly believes in the mission of the coop and does everything by the book. She is understanding and consistent in her work.","Supervisor has responded to my schedule requests in a fair way. Consistent feedback on problems would be helpful to me instead of hearing only about negatives after no contact for months. Left me wondering if I actually sucked at my job and no one was telling me.","Our department supervisors are absolutely amazing and do everything they can to support us.","Nothing of note","Hunter is by far the best supervisor I’ve ever had.","Malu is a great leader and works with us side by side when we need it. she always listens and helps us achieve our goals and supports us and actually cares about us and her job. it has been very hard to see her treated so badly by upper management. from the outside it is clear she has been bullied and pushed out and has been treated unprofessionally and unfairly.","These responses are regarding the  front end manager, not the lead","I feel as though Andrea does a great job of working with people's individual circumstances and addressing issues that arise. However, there are times when employees have brought issues to her attention regarding the challenges and performance issues with the Cafe lead that seem to not be taken care of. It can feel like there is a lot that is left up to part-time employees that should be directed to the leads of each department. There has also been a noticeable lack of effort from Cafe leads in regards to closing procedures and backtalk to employees. Although they have seniority, it is unfair and wrong for employees to be looked down on by leads.","My supervisor is the Wellness Manager.  It has been very difficult to work with her as she makes changes without notice, adding more work to our plate, doesn't understand the day-to-day tasks or support necessary to complete our work in a reasonable timeline, doesn't do the work necessary during her shift and leaves it for the person covering the next shift.  Our ideas are not heard.  When we question new tasks or workflows, she has responded with \"I am the manager, and this is how I say to do it\" even if it doesn't make sense and is unnecessary.","How should I know if they make decisions fairly and equally, no matter my opinion, how would I even know? I don't see the decisions they make; I can't truthfully tell you when the last time I saw them work on the floor or even bring up a decision-making option for anything,","There has been a transition with 3 different supervisors since I was hired into the position in June.","My dept is one of the if not the best team of people I've ever worked for.","Malu is simply the best boss I've ever had, she deserves to be recognized for her efforts more often than she is.","My departments manger is an incredible leader, boss, and does the most work out of anyone. Truly an incredible work ethic, always is helping within the department, makes sure employees are able to work at there best, and always help push her employees to be the best of themselves. Unfortunately over the last few months our manger has been getting harassed, blamed for placed evidence, and overall have made it where she had to leave to have a peace of mind.","We work together well","My supervisor is a dim-wit who kisses ass and is praised for it.","My response to these questions was regarding the cafe shift lead as the supervisor. I feel our gm is very much on top of things. The cafe lead can tend to be boastful and seem kind of full of himself. Mainly because there isn’t a second lead anymore to help with check and balances.","My supervisor is very new, and I'm training him. I'm not comfortable having an opinion yet.","There is only so much that can be done in that position. Some of the more concerning issues have to come with authorization from above, and getting that can be difficult for a variety of reasons."]},{"Question":"90. Comments about Job Satisfaction?","Comments":["I think my dissatisfaction can be referenced in my previous comments answers in the survey. Pay, communication, upholding equal expectations, and morale are not sufficient for many.","I would like to be proud to work here. I was when I started. Oryana has lost soul and substance, leaning on appearances and name more than the original values.","yall are getting worse","Love working with local small businesses and have created some friends of fellow employees but I could never tell someone to work here with how upper management operates. It's the disconnect seen all too often in corporate America.","although there are things that could be improved, for the most part i am quite happy to be here","i wish i could be proud here but I usually feel like im constantly behind and falling short of expectations. I have begged for support for so long that it doesn't seem worth it anymore. I have sweat and cried and bled for oryana and the best they can do is a 3% raise and a shitty pizza party. I am considered leadership but i have very little chance to lead anything; i am oryana's culinary cop, taking orders and enforcing laws that I have little say in the creation of. I can make recipes and write menus and cook my ass off in a single day and all you have me do is cook soup and write on clipboards.","There was a time not long ago, where I would have strongly agreed with every statement above.  At this point in time, the workplace is beginning to feel toxic, and intimidating thanks to the actions of the upper management.","previously i would have recommended oryana as an employer, but i do not any more. recent changes to how my department is run, and the co-op as a whole, are hypocritical to the stated mission of the co-op, and have reduced morale in the work place","I <3 Oryana. I am satisfied.","New Health Benefit Packages are lack luster. The New attendance policy, which doesn't apply to all, is crap! This attendance policy basically states....... YOU ARE BETTER OFF CALLING IN THAN SHOWING UP LATE!","There is a desire for improved flexibility with PTO or unpaid time-off requests. Work/life balance is important, and employees should not have to worry about having enough PTO to take an extra day off when needed.","This is the highlight of my employment at Oryana. I have never worked for an organization that I felt this certain was a good place doing good things for my community in good faith and for good reasons. I would consider the previous statement to be the highest praise that I could provide for an employer. I like waking up before work and not having to question whether I was doing something that has a positive influence on the world.","Regarding question 86, I feel very valued by my department supervisor and my department peers, but I feel like a mere number to upper management for how little they interact with me or care about me other than my performance. I am proud to work for Oryana based on our community involvement and what we provide for customers.  Oryana does good for workplace diversity and creating a positive work environment. This is made possible by the employees who do the real work. We create the environment and that makes this job bearable.","I think my direct coworkers see my value, but outside of our department, I don’t feel much appreciation. We’re rarely thanked in the newsletter and don’t get much feedback outside of negative customer complaints.","I feel valued by the people I work directly with on the floor but not by the people in upper management. I feel like many of them look down on me and neither ask for or value my input. Many decisions seem to be made by one person based on their personal preferences for \"appearances\" and not on what actually works best for the store.","I REALLY USED TO BE PROUD OF MY CO-OP. NOW, CUSTOMERS AND VENDORS THAT I KNOW ASK ME ABOUT WHY IT FEELS BAD HERE. THOUGH I DON'T SAY ANYTHING, I AM PLAIN EMBARRASSED TO TALK ABOUT BEING PART OF IT.","Again, this attendence policy has been really bad for morale.","More customers, less employees, busier than ever, system \"upgrades\" that are one step forward three steps back, management seen less on the floor, lots of turnaround. On the whole it's ok and better than other jobs, but it's not as good to come to work as it was in the first year or so.","I enjoy my job here very much.  I find myself smiling when walking in the door.  I enjoy interactions with both customers and co-workers.  I am pleased with Oryana's values as they are important to me. I wish that staff had more input in scheduling.","I don't think Oryana is aligned with their mission as much as they used to be. It's hard to watch a great coop lean into the corporate obsession with maximizing profits and growth over the employees that are the reason it exists. Maintenance is not the enemy. We can maintain and take care of the employees and still be successful. Success is not solely defined as growth. It is the accomplishment of a purpose.","I like working at Oryana. The factors that contribute to that have not been addressed on this survey.","the connection between our customers is why I can enjoy my job.","I like working here. I think it is as fair a place as possible.","Nothing of note","my feelings of value come from my interactions with customers, not from leadership. half of the managers do not acknowledge staff only each other. I have seen Oryana decline in the treatment of its employees and how they are valued and would not recommend it as a place to work. the new attendance policy is draconian, you could be fired for having a car accident and being late; yet Store managers forget they are supposed to be at work and it is laughed off.","I was very satisfied with my job when I first started working here, but as time went on, and with recent changes, it feels like I am working for any other corporate grocery store in America. I wish that the \"Ends Values\" were acted upon as much as they are spoken about.","I am proud to work here.  I just want better communication between Admin and employees.","I am grateful for our employee discount & benefit package. Thank you.","I would love to say I love this job and at one time I did, even for little pay, but the shift in management and her style of managing has been harmful and distressing.  I went from having a schedule that was equitable and consistent to loosing hours and coerced into working weekends when I don't have reliable childcare.  This change occurred following an incident where my manager walked in on me and a coworker venting to each other about the abrupt changes and disorganization.  I brought these concerns to my manager and now I'm actively looking for another job as I was explicitly told by my manager \"if I were you, I'd be looking for another job\".  I lost my shift with this coworker and we haven't worked together since. I do not want to find another job but feel insecure and uncomfortable continuing to work under this specific manager. We have a new store manager Justin who has improved out department morale significantly and I hope we can have a sit down and figure out a way for me to have an equitable opportunity","There have been a few times this year where I have felt like there's no narrative at work. Like we've lost the plot. We let go of a lot of people this year (deservedly), and while being short staffed we made more than we ever thought possible. And the reward for our hard work was like a pizza party after being asked to work harder.","I used to feel like oryana would a staple in our town and was honored to work at such a wonderful place that truly valued people, environment, whole foods, and the community but I am at a point where I actually feel ashamed working here. There as I stated been numerous things that I just barley touched on. It has truly become a space of discouragement.","Oryana is evolving, and with that comes positive  and negative responses from staff. This year I have seen a general decline in the positive energy around the Coop and that has made work a bit more challenging at times.","I enjoy working at Oryana, the employees and management are kind and generally fun to be around.  (can't be perfect all the time) .","Oryana is the hardest job for the least pay I've ever worked. That being said, HD has heard my needs and acted accordingly on several occasions.","best job I've had in my life so far and till this day i still love it","I am proud to work here and show people the store. I am unhappy with my compensation given my dedicated work over the years.","Employees who work hard like to hear every now and again, it lets us know you are paying attention to what's going on. A general \"hey you all are doing great\" doesn't quite cut it.  I also would rather just get paid more than have a staff lunch day."]}],"results":{"Overall":{"response":"The survey comments reveal a predominantly negative sentiment, particularly directed at Oryana's upper management and a perceived departure from core co-op values. Employees express widespread dissatisfaction with compensation, citing uncompetitive wages, insufficient raises, and declining benefits that struggle to meet the high cost of living. A recurring theme is the criticism of management practices, described as disconnected, micromanaging, lacking transparency, and often leading to feelings of disrespect, unheard concerns, and even experiences of harassment and retaliation.\n\nCommunication is consistently highlighted as poor, with critical information often spread through informal channels or delivered last-minute without employee input. Many feel that the co-op's values are now more about 'virtue signaling' or marketing than genuine action, impacting morale and creating a stressful, understaffed, and often inequitable work environment. While some direct supervisors and immediate team dynamics receive positive feedback, these bright spots are largely overshadowed by systemic issues that have led to a significant decline in overall job satisfaction and pride in working for Oryana.","sentiment":-0.669},"8.
