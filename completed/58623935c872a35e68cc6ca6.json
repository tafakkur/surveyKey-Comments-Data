{"comments":[{"Question":"11. Comments on the Co-op's values?","Comments":["I hear negative comments about boomers. When it comes to age diversity and inclusion are not respected.","I would like to see even more discussion of how the co-op is contributing to local events that are not just school. I would like marketing to reach out to organizations in the area that are for diverse groups on campus at U of I or Inland Oasis and offer food/drink as much as they do for other local orgs. Discussions of why we support the organizations and how and how often is important to me.","The values of the coop was what brought me to the bakehouse in the first place. Its been a delight to see those values practiced and encouraged in person, and to see it spread in our community.","They are commendable and I strongly believe in them","We were recently told during a re-orientation that we were not to speak about our beliefs/lifestyle at work and if asked by a customer to engage in a conversation, we were to say that, we at the co-op, do not speak of these things. I understand that keeping the peace is important, but if we don't acknowledge each others differences, how will we learn to love people that aren't like us. burying our heads in the sand is not the answer","I feel the Co-op could follow through on their commitment to honoring different abilities and valuing diversity by providing clearer access to accommodations and more dialogue to communicate needs. I feel unsure of the safety of disclosing my different abilities and the accommodations that would be helpful to have.","none at the moment, thankyou.","The Co-op would preach about it's \"diverse values\"while in the past the store manager has made posts about problems with \"straight white privilege\". This is not only contradictory but has no real value to anything that could be considered work related what so ever. Though I believe the Co-op values are good overall, I also see certain political leaning values that have no place in a grocery store.","Environmentally friendly, socially responsible, and healthful choices are limited for people below a certain income.","I find it heart warming that The CoOp values as so strong. A preivous job a person came in scared to ask if she could come in because she is gay. I dont feel that here at all.","To be a healthy and thriving environment, I do not believe a points based attendance system is helpful to the mental health of employees. Life happens and we shouldn't be punished further if we are already down on our luck-- however that may be-- sickness, school, pets, etc. A points system is a lazy way of weeding out employees, we all deserve to not feel like our job is on the line due to being sick and thus having people come in sick/over tired/ stressed/etc and not be able to perform their job duties to the best of their abilities. I understand some people may try to take advantage of a no points system, but we need something more reasonable that doesn't feel like we are being micromanaged like high schoolers.","i appreciate the commitment to community. i feel involved.","values are my co-workers skills and work ethic. Kitchen creates a positive and fun work environment, which in return creates a great team and positive outcomes. I believe all departments have this same values","We are a very inclusive and community driven space with standards befitting professional expectations.","Lots of great people, great leadership.","I think it’s important for Moscow, ID to have organizations like the co-op that are committed to diversity and equity. Especially as the political climate continues to be (increasingly) hostile.","the co - op is/has beenone sided on the \"LEFT & RIGHT \"questions, on one hand everything is accepted, on the other hand (the right side of beliefs and politics) \"there will be no political discussions at work \"why can one side be talked about all day long but one moment of anything to do with religion or right leaning ( I am neither religious or right leaning, I am center left for context ) it is shut down as political discussion.\n\nwould like to see the co - op divest from any political orientation and just sell groceries.","The success of the practice of these values in my strong opinion is attributed to the constant emphasis and clear expectations that upper management has places on these","I think the co-op truly does pride itself on support of historically marginalized communities but I also think the co-op could be better at reacting to community displeasure like we often experienced as a result of the Black Lives Matter signs.Without question, the sentiment is relevant but the organization itself was responsible for things that understandably upset members of our community.I think at times we can be to focused on DEI at the exclusion of a potentially larger market.I think there is a fairer balance to walk to live up to our motto of \"All are Welcome.\"In addition, I think a strenuous look at why we carry products from Israel is needed.To advocate for minorities but also carry products from Israel seems a strange path to walk.","I think they are good values worth upholding."]},{"Question":"19. Comments on Storewide Management Practices?","Comments":["They say the right words but don't really practice what they preach.","I have been mostly without conflict throughout my job here at the co-op. When conflict has come up it has been resolved to my satisfaction and fairly.","I feel free to voice my opinion without fear of retaliation","I think management, as it is, is quick to pass the buck. Management tends to delegate instead of stepping in.\nThere are responsibilities that are neglected if there aren't enough people present. It seems that emails and meetings, trump, no pun intended,\nthe needs of the store, primarily on freight days and when the front end is short on cashiers.\nI have also seen M.O.D.s not have the knowledge or resources to deal with a problem, not always, but it would be embarrassing to be caught in a situation like that","I appreciate the point system and how it encourages us to come to work but I do think it could use some tweaks. Currently it encourages us to work even if we are sick to avoid getting points. I think we should get a few unpaid sick days each year that we can use without the fear of getting a point. I don't think it’s necessary to always see a professional doctor if I have a normal cold just to get a doctor’s note that reduces my whole point for missing a day to a .25 point. When sick, we tend to not be able to work our full potential and getting a point encourages us to come to work and waste labor. Getting a few sick days after being here for a year would also encourage someone to stay working here for a longer period because they would feel benefit from being a long-term worker. As of right now, we have the same point system for the time we start until the time we stop working here even if we have proven to our manager that we come to work on time and show up to all our shifts.","Overall, I feel Heather and Melinda have done an impressive job managing the Co-op","The storewide management has a history of being unfair to the employees. I've seen many instances of other managers being lenient on certain things that my own manager would fire someone for. These include time management and work ethics. The co-op managers and higher staff would preach \"equality\",while having no outward point system of their own to follow. They then would expect most workers to just sit there and accept the clear and consistent lack of equality they receive while getting minimum wage. I speak for many workers in the store when I say that the management always finds a way to fire people when they decide to openly question the management. All of this and we still question why our turn-over rate is so high. Considering these are all problems that have been brought to management in the past, I have little hope that a survey will actually change anything.","There is a lack of efficient communication between departments, and even between managers within the same departments. Additionally, most decision-making relies on the bottom line. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it feels as if maximizing profit can sometimes outweigh balanced expectations for employees. Decisions have been made in the past that do not necessarily take into account employee input. (Decisions that make our jobs unreasonably tedious or more time-consuming than they should be.)","Top management is devoting too much time to their work, too few days off, too few days where they are truly disconnected. Their work/life balance is tilted too much toward work, and I feel like there is downward pressure for others to show that same level of all-in devotion.","There is a manager who has consistently talked down to employees and treats people like poop if they call out or even asking for time off because of a death in the family. I do not understand why the Co-op keeps this person as a member of management over losing at least 10 members of staff (some who needed to go, but some really hard working employees) over the last few years due to his terrible people skills, lack of good leader skills, and a consistent need to flex his authority position over others.","Management at the Moscow Food Co-op is the most understanding and empathetic I have ever experienced anywhere.","i’ve had nothing but stellar communication and sincere consideration for my work needs","A great system that in return creates good communication between managers and higher ups, I can always come to anyone with concerns that happen outside of work.","I believe that the everyday modus operandi which establishes usual expectations can sometimes be bent to fit the immediate desires of management at times.","Great people to process your questions and concerns.","They are doing the best they can no worries here","I have very little to no interaction with storewide management practices.","Sometimes it feels like some policies are cherry picked on what is followed and what is not. Or the employees are cherry picked on who gets reprimanded for the same thing.\n\nAlso, there have been some concerns I have heard co-workers talk about amongst each other but not one person has brought it to management, I believe because of the fear of retaliation or fear of nothing being done.","I think that management genuinely cares about employees and their needs, however there may be a bit of a disconnect at times. There seems to be a lack of communication between employees and upper management in the sense that employees are not always asked about their needs. I have also seen employees bring up issues to upper management (especially regarding conflicts with their supervisors) and be ignored.","The management team is exactly what the term means: a team with common and clear goals which I feel we work greatly together to achieve","In my long tenure here, I feel the management team is more balance and respectful than I've ever seen it.I'm very proud of the work they have been doing.","They pretty good"]},{"Question":"26. Comments on Workplace Communications?","Comments":["Lacking in general","Not enough of my coworkers use it and there isn't much push back on people who do not. The managers encourage us to use it but that's basically as far as it goes. I don't know what managers can do to implore people to use it because punishment isn't what I want, but it does get tiring having to tell people things that they could easily find out themselves. It is mostly tiring because communicating about things that were posted on Beekeeper is rarely if ever given positive feedback. Or it feels like the person I'm telling doesn't care all that much and it feels like it wasted my time and hurt my morale when my coworkers don't care as much.","Beekeeper I still struggle to consistently check. And I don't always feel like I know what's going on at the coop since as a baker most of my information and knowledge is at the. Bakehouse. Though I suppose Beekeeper is supposed to help me understand what's happening at the Coop Store itself, but the times when I do check onBeekeeper, it doesn't always feel like I'm getting the full picture eitherBut the important information seems to come through","I think there is lack of planning for employee turnover","communication could be more between departments and and management. It could be more frequent and clearer.","Employee ideas are asked for and heard in our department but not necessarilyacted upon or used. When asked for our thoughts, we get a chance to voice our opinions but they are usually deflected by our manager who seems to already have their own ideas and thoughts on the matter. I would like to see more of our ideas put to use or acted upon rather than just being heard.","Management does a good job of using Beekeeper to communicate with employees","Workplace communications have been very good overall. BeeKeeper is a nice place to see updates from all different departments. This helps customer interactions too.","There are few opportunities for employee input when it comes to changes that affect how we perform our work. Oftentimes, we find out after the decision is made. I do think that BeeKeeper is a useful stream of communication that should be utilized more.","There are sometimes some communication breakdowns between departments IE:when management makes decisions and rolls things out without proper training etc","The open communication here is wonderful","It is common to have some lack of communication when it comes to equipment failure.","There has been an increase in communication from admin. The communication from management as a team is unpredictable and could be simply improved with more Beekeeper usage.","I appreciate BeeKeeper it is a great tool to communicate. It's important to remind staff to mark that they read a post with a \"like\".","it’s nice and efficient here. things are very clear but open to be modified. and in a timely manner, not common in other workplaces","Beekeeper and paycom are easy to access and always accurate. I love keeping up with news on co-op related matters and store changes that are easy to read and good communication.","I wish there were more tactile methods of communication. Such as a physical department noticeboard.","Wish they would let you know when they are changing your schedule so you don’t come in at the wrong time.","Sometimes recipes are not accurate in terms of making because we recently re-evaluated the cost of items to make sure they meet the proper pricing. This has occasionally caused confusion as some recipes reflect the cost measurements instead of the make measurements.management is not always around to correct them but it’s not a huge issue","Lots of changes in the kitchen not easy to keep everything updated but everyone does their best at letting people know","Overall positive, with room for improvement.","I generally only receive information from two people regardless of format:my manager and the store manager.","There have been multiple times when something has changed and I have not been informed of the change, and so when a customer asks me about it I have no idea what they're talking about. This has mostly been internally in the department. \nThere have also been times where my supervisor said they would make a beekeeper post informing everyone about what's going on and about any changes, and there not being a post at all.","Lines of communication are always open","Beekeeper is an amazing tool in appropriate and prompt communication.I am personally grateful to have it to assist my job duties","Communication feels better than ever as well.","communication has been improved over the years"]},{"Question":"32. Comments on Compensation?","Comments":["A huge reason I value this job is that the compensation and benefits are useful to me. I appreciate that all of these benefits are available to both part time and full time employees. I have utilized the EAP and Ally Health throughout my time here.","I feel I do more work than others in the same position.","Fairly satisfied, thank-you.","I believe the pay scale pays upper management and marketing too much for the lack of actual strenuous work they do. The kitchen and front end all deserve at least a dollar raise. This is due to the kitchen being a hot and stressful environment to work in and the front end having to clean bathrooms. The turnover rate is so high because young people in this town know they can do better elsewhere.","I wish there were more opportunities to make more. Most people, even if promoted to PIC, don't get to work as PIC often because lead or management is there. New hires also being placed into leadership roles can be frustrating when you haven't earned a pay raise and have to teach the new hires. I think having pay raises besides PIC or lead just based off performance and knowledge of the departmen, attendance, policy adherence, and customer service skills would be valuable and a big motivator for people. It is a big complaint amongst most employees.","I think that the upper cap for management pay is an important and needed safeguard. I think that the benefits offered here make the pay more reasonable.","The one time I tried to use Ally Health, I didn't hear from one of their providers for over half a day. At that point I cancelled and went to local Quick Care instead. A few hours later a provider from Ally Health finally called, even though I had cancelled.","Wish we did cost of living raises instead of whatever we do. I feel like as someone who has been here 3+ years, I should be making more than 75 cents/hour more than someone who just started at the coop. I also feel that if you are a PIC, you should be getting that extra dollar an hour whether you are the pic or not. You still are asked to do some pic things even when you are not the pic and you have the knowledge and skills every shift, not just the pic scheduled ones. I'd feel more valued as a long time employee if i was making $16.75/hour every shift because of my pic training and experience and length of time i have been here","Works really well. Ally health is a very useful way foranything health related. Plus it's easy to access.","Seeing more substantial pay would likely be well-received in relation to current financial trends outside the co-op. Simply put, things are getting expensive.","If im being honest here I would preform my job effectively and at a faster pace while my fellow colleagues taking their time at the same job.","part time, don't use medical/dental/vision benefits","I don’t know the pay for other positions or departments. I’m unfamiliar with the system for pay raises.","I don't think anyone has any idea how the pay raises work, we have a \"performance evaluation rais matrix \"but I don't know the last time this was used, the last raise i got was not based on any form of math that i could figure out and was almost humiliating to get offered, of which I said that I would like a higher rais more akin to the performance sheet that we have \n(of which the performance sheet would have me at a higher rais than I ultimately received)\n\njust would like more regular raises and more clarity, they don't have to be large raises, just a clear path","Very good benefit package for full-time employees","I feel that I am considered valuable due to compensation and am grateful for the benefits including profit sharing","I hope we get to a place where raises are predictable and based on merit or hours worked.The whiplash of the last few years has been rewarding in the sense of us raising our bottom tier and lifting all boats but it has been challenging to not know until a new year or later what the plan is.","it pretty good"]},{"Question":"41.

I have been here the longest besides Amellia and I feel that is because I have consistently gone to her with questions/concerns/overall work communication.

I've noticed many times that leaves early to avoid O.T. I'm unsure of his agreement with his own supervisor but i find that to be hypocritical to the policy he enforces for his workers.\n-We are expected to request time off 4-7 weeks before the date we are trying to get off. I understand for scheduling purposes that it is helpful, however this makes work life balance very difficult. Things come up and knowing my life that far in advance for a single day off is very difficult and makes me miss out on things regularly. When requesting time off (even when they are 4-7 weeks in advance) he regularly asked why we need it off and what we are doing to base his decision off if he’ll approve it or not. We are told we shouldn’t purchase travel expenses (planes, hotels, etc.)until the time off is approved but sometimes my time off isn’t approved until a week before the days I requested off.I’ve heard from co-workers that their managers are more flexible when it comes to requesting time off. I think the Co-op should make a standardized request off policy that every manager must uphold. Something I value is flexibility and there has been many times I’ve adjusted my out of work schedule to help the store and I would expect that would be reciprocated but I have not seen that within my department. \n\nQuestion #69 - There tends to be very little recognition that we are doing good work and most of our daily work task seem to go unnoticed unless there is a criticism.There's been many beekeeper post explaining how something was done insufficiently but very little post about things being done to his standards.","My supervisor often acts very anxious, compulsively micromanages, and generally offers no positive encouragement or praise.

One main example is how we are told to cook the Mac’s for the hot bar is in constant flux depending on the manager in kitchen.","They are doing the best they can","I have more than one supervisor, they are both good but different","They're good.","As for Question 71:Yes my supervisor encourages us to share ideas, suggestions and concerns, but a majority of the time they do not take these ideas into account, even if the rest of the department agrees.","I appreciate that there is always an open dialogue with my supervisor.

Comments on Job Satisfaction?","Comments":["I only find myself not all the way agreeing with the co-op being a great place to work because I'm not privy to the way the downtown store functions day-to-day in terms of relationships with/communication with/enforcement of policies there.","Conditions could always be better. The chronic shorthandedness could be better avoided with better hirings and more upfrontness about the job expectations and heiring for the time of day needed to be filled.","Question #78 + #80 + #83 -I enjoy working at the co-op and in a lot of ways it is better than most of the other jobs I’ve worked at. The department I’m in has a toxic and exhausting energy that tends to drain me. I go through long periods of time that I feel like no value to the department because I am told certain things need to get fixed and never that I’m doing a good job. The few times I have been told that I’m doing a good job by my department manager, they have felt forced and unwanted to be told.I think if certain things change within my department I would love to continue working here for an extended amount of time.","Other than one person, I have overall quite enjoyed working at the Co-op. Lots of friendly people.","I feel valued by my department with my day-to-day tasks. I do not feel especially valued by upper management at times.","lovely place lovely people and how lovely i get paid to be here","The co-op has been a wonderful and great learning experience.

Yes, there are occasional downs, but that's just how life is, with ups and downs. \nMy coworkers both in my department and in other departments are wonderful.\nIt's a very welcoming environment, and a fun place to work. \nEvery time a friend is looking for a job I recommend the co-op.","I would recommend the co-op as a place to work with some exceptions based on management style of certain departments. Although I really enjoy the department I work in, I have heard from other coworkers in other departments that they clash with their manager and feel unheard and disrespected by their manager. One manager in particular micro-manages to the point that multiple people have quit after minor disagreements escalated. These people also brought their concerns to upper management and were ignored.","I am proud to work here, more so now that we are starting to lean more towards the center, for example:keeping the American flag up for the month of July, right after pride month (it used to be just for one day)\n\na lot of us just want less political involvement OVERALL away from both sides, WE work here and do not want OUR image as workers to be included one side or the other. I have talked to many who feel the same, we want to be a grocery store to all peoples providing good food for all walks of life in a comfortable way, that means being neutral.","This is one of the few jobs that I have had in my career where I can genuinely say I have felt the most inclusion in issues such as decision making that affects all departments and emphasis on team members","Even though I've worked here a long time, I sure do appreciate this place."]}],"results":{"Overall":{"response":"The overall sentiment across all survey comments is slightly positive (0.027), indicating a generally neutral to mildly positive atmosphere, but with significant underlying issues. While many employees express strong appreciation for the Co-op's core values, community involvement, and the positive relationships with their co-workers, there are pervasive concerns about management practices, communication inefficiencies, and the perceived fairness and transparency of internal processes. Key areas of discontent include inconsistent policy application, particularly regarding attendance and time-off requests, a lack of clarity in compensation and promotion structures, and widespread dissatisfaction with training and evaluation methods, which are often described as rushed and unhelpful. A critical theme is the impact of certain department managers, whose micro-management, harsh tones, and perceived lack of respect significantly undermine job satisfaction and contribute to high turnover. Additionally, there's a strong desire for the Co-op to maintain political neutrality and ensure its diversity and inclusion values are applied consistently and fairly across all demographics and viewpoints. Physical store conditions in some departments also require attention. The Co-op has a solid foundation of positive values and dedicated employees, but needs to address systemic issues in management, communication, and human resources practices to ensure a truly equitable and supportive workplace for all.","sentiment":0.027},"11.

This includes concerns about perceived one-sided political discussions and lack of respect for age diversity.","Many employees are genuinely drawn to and appreciate the Co-op's values, particularly regarding community involvement, environmental responsibility, and creating an inclusive, positive work environment.","There's a call for the Co-op to better align its actions with its stated values, particularly concerning accommodations for different abilities, addressing community displeasure, and ensuring all community groups feel equally welcome.

There's also a strong concern about fear of retaliation when voicing issues.","There are recurring complaints about a 'lack of efficient communication' between and within departments, management tending to 'pass the buck' rather than step in, and decisions being made without employee input, leading to 'tedious' or 'time-consuming' jobs.","While some employees praise management for being 'understanding and empathetic,' having 'stellar communication,' and fostering a 'great system,' these positive experiences are frequently juxtaposed with or overshadowed by strong negative feedback regarding specific managers exhibiting 'terrible people skills,' 'talking down to employees,' and causing high staff turnover."]},"26.

There's a call for stronger encouragement or reinforcement for its use.","Many comments highlight issues where employees are not informed of changes (e.g., schedule, policies, internal department shifts) in a timely manner, if at all. Decisions are often communicated after they are made, and employee input is rarely sought or acted upon, leading to frustration and disengagement.","Communication breakdowns are noted between departments and within management, with some managers deflecting employee ideas or failing to provide proper training when changes are rolled out.

Employees express not understanding the system, feeling undervalued, and desiring raises based on performance, tenure, and cost of living adjustments. One comment described a raise offer as 'humiliating.'","There's a strong sentiment that pay scales are imbalanced, with upper management potentially overpaid for less strenuous work compared to demanding roles like the kitchen and front-end. This is linked to high turnover rates among younger staff who feel they can find better compensation elsewhere.","While compensation itself is a pain point, the overall benefits package (EAP, Ally Health, availability to part-time staff) is largely appreciated and considered a significant factor in job value, despite one negative experience with Ally Health's responsiveness."]},"41.

There's also a sense of departments running too independently, hindering overall efficiency.","Despite the operational and facility issues, several comments praise the strong teamwork, communication, and efficiency among co-workers within departments, indicating that employees often 'help out to get things done' and are 'consciously engaged' in the Co-op's success."]},"50.

This can lead to frustration regarding workload distribution and accountability.","Despite the managerial and organizational challenges, many employees highlight a positive culture within their immediate teams, praising co-worker collaboration, efficiency, and mutual support.

However, strong negative comments cite concerns about HR not keeping information private, perceived bias against certain staff, and a fear of retaliation preventing harassment claims from being reported.","While there's appreciation for diversity in hiring, one significant concern is that inclusive hiring practices for individuals with disabilities can sometimes lead to a 'strain on the department' if individuals cannot perform job duties effectively, resulting in other team members having to 'pick up the slack.'","A strong negative feedback point is the perceived political leaning of the Co-op's upper management, particularly concerning posts about 'straight white privilege,' which makes some employees feel 'uneasy and awkward' and believe that 'political garbage' has no place in the work environment."]},"66.

These behaviors lead to frustration, particularly regarding time-off requests and inconsistent policy application.","Issues include supervisors enforcing 'hypocritical' attendance policies, making time-off requests 'very difficult' and subjective, and giving 'conflicting instructions' on day-to-day tasks.
