{"content":{"parts":[{"text":"{\n  \"Overall\": {\n    \"response\": \"The survey comments reveal a complex and often contradictory picture of the Co-op's internal environment. While many employees express strong appreciation for the Co-op's values, particularly its commitment to community, diversity, and inclusivity, there's significant discontent regarding the practical application of these values. Recurring themes include concerns about inconsistent management practices, a perceived lack of genuine employee input, and communication breakdowns, particularly between departments and with upper management. Compensation is a mixed bag, with some appreciating benefits but many desiring clearer, more equitable, and predictable raise structures tied to performance and tenure. Training and development are frequently cited as rushed and intimidating, leading to stress and inefficiency. Employee satisfaction is heavily influenced by departmental management styles, with some departments fostering positive environments while others are described as toxic and micromanaging. There's a strong desire for the Co-op to maintain neutrality on political matters, focusing instead on its core grocery business and fostering an 'All are Welcome' environment for both staff and customers.\",\n    \"sentiment\": 0.087\n  },\n  \"11.
