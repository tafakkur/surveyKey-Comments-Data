While there's a strong undercurrent of appreciation for the Co-op's values, community, and direct managerial support, significant frustrations emerge regarding operational inconsistencies, management practices, and compensation. Many employees express deep pride in the Co-op's mission and culture, citing it as a major reason for their job satisfaction and loyalty. However, this positive sentiment is often tempered by critical feedback on systemic issues, particularly a perceived disconnect between stated values and their practical application.

Many of the flowers and fruits the Coop sells are sourced from the global south, which is unsustainable for the earth when we consider the fossil fuel dependent supply chains these sorts of operations rely on. Instead if the Coop was to limit the range from which it procured it's products it would become more sustainable. The result of this, of course, is that the selection of fruits and vegetables would be less exotic and more seasonal, but most of us would probably trade fewer kiwis for an inhabitable planet. \\\"Sustainable luxury good\\\" is an oxymoron.\\n\\nThe Coop engages in many of the exploitative labor practices that every other company does. I have observed penny pinching when it comes to wages and hours. Often the management has no problem over working employees and does not respond to attempts at communication from those who are most stressed. Perhaps this comes more from bureaucracy than from intentional malignancy. The Coop benefits are good, but also wages are exceptionally standard. \\n\\nFinally, it is important to realize the cost of shopping at the Coop is substantially higher than at other grocery stores. Maybe the comparative increase in prices are necessary when accounting for organic practices, quality, and sustainability. However, this means that the community that the Coop ends up serving is really just the well-to-dos in Bozeman, not the community at large. Providing at least some cheap food not aimed at the upper-class of Bozeman would be important to meet this End. I pay attention to how many calories I can get for a dollar.

For example when Traes was working here and Scott drove her to quit by yelling in her face when she was going home early frequently because her brother had passed away not even two months prior.....The entire time she was working after her brother died she wasnt provided any support from her direct manager or the general manager Rory. It wasnt until after she was pushed to her limit and Scott brought her to the back that she was given any semblance of anything??? from her direct manager. Very disturbing. She wasn't given the time to mourn or the support she needed from said manager. When your staff and managers are worried about taking specific actions to help their staff members who are running your store I think that would be a time to step back and maybe reevaluate. Especially when your staff and management know what they should be doing but are too scared to do it.

I also find Steve to be less intimidating than others do and have an easier time speaking freely with him.

Anytime I help someone of another department, I feel that I am going to get in trouble from my manager because it is not within our department, even if it is not taking away from my work at all.
