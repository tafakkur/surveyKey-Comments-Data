While a significant portion of employees express high job satisfaction, praising positive coworker relationships, a welcoming environment, and specific managers for their leadership, these positives are often overshadowed by pervasive systemic issues. Key areas of concern include a perceived lack of fairness and transparency in compensation and promotion, inconsistent management practices, and critical breakdowns in communication and training. There is a strong sentiment that the Co-op's stated values, particularly regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and being 'All are Welcome,' are not consistently reflected in practice, especially concerning political neutrality and the application of policies. Operational and infrastructure deficiencies in specific departments, coupled with fears of retaliation and ignored feedback, contribute to a sense of frustration and distrust among many. While tools like Beekeeper and specific managers receive high praise, their positive impact is often limited by broader organizational inconsistencies and underutilization.\",\n    \"sentiment\": \"Slightly Positive (0.09)\"\n  },\n  \"11.
