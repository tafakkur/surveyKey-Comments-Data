{"content":{"parts":[{"text":"{\n  \"Overall\": \"The survey comments reveal a complex and often contradictory employee experience at the Co-op. While many employees express profound appreciation for the Co-op's values, community-focused mission, and a generally supportive work culture, significant concerns emerge across several key areas. There's a strong positive sentiment regarding the benefits package, particularly health insurance, and the positive impact of direct managers and coworkers on daily job satisfaction. However, a recurring theme of frustration arises concerning compensation, with many feeling that wages do not adequately address the high cost of living in Bozeman, and a strong desire for merit-based raises. Communication, especially between departments, locations, and between upper management and frontline staff, is consistently highlighted as a major weakness, leading to inefficiencies and feelings of being unheard. Trust in \\\"People & Culture\\\" (HR) and upper management is notably low, with reports of inconsistency, defensiveness, and a perceived lack of support for marginalized employees or in addressing serious workplace issues. There's also a sense of an increasing \\\"corporate\\\" direction that some feel deviates from core Co-op values, impacting everything from sustainability practices to employee treatment and the overall workplace environment. Overall, the Co-op appears to be a workplace cherished for its ideals and interpersonal connections, but one struggling with systemic issues related to communication, fair compensation, consistent management practices, and effectively living up to its stated values, particularly regarding support for its diverse staff.\",\n  \"10.
